Dr. Nabil Malak,"I have been dealing with the Qc healthcare system since 2011, being treated like a number, feeling like my life didn't mater and I felt worthless until I was referred to Dr Malak in the Fall 2015. He was my savior in so many ways. He really made me feel like he cared and that I mattered. He made me feel like I was worth his time and effort. I had my surgery in May 2016 and I was overwhelmed with the way I was treated by the staff in the surgery room. It almost felt like I was at a spa, music in my ears, heated cover, leg massager, etc... Dr. Malak was the best surgeon I have ever had. He not only took care of my physical health, he also took great care of my mental health without really knowing he was. The way he treated his patient had a great impact on their recovery. I was very saddened this week when I heard that he had passed. I will really miss him. My sincere condolences to his family, colleagues and to his patients as well.

Dr. Phil Inouye,"I must say among all physians whom I have dealt with, Dr Inouye is the best in all aspects. Not only does he listen to you attentatively but also patiently answer every single question you ask. Some physians may be very politie, but you don't get the ""genuine"" feelings from them. Brenda, the secretary, is also extremely helpful. I completely got the nasty gastrorelux under control by Dr Inouye. Thank you Dr Inouye!","August 9, 2017",1,1,1,1

Dr. Phil Inouye,"I have had him as my Doctor for over 8 years now and he pretty much saved my life at the beginning of it all. During my diagnosis he answered every single one of mine and my families questions (even the stupid ones) and he never once made me feel dumb or unintelligent. He explained everything in great detail (scientifically and basically) on many occasions and has extremely good bed side manner. I felt like I was in very good hands during the whole process, and I still do to this day! He takes his time with me, making me feel like he cares about my well being. I don't think i have anything bad to say about him. Thank you Dr. Inouye!","March 30, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Phil Inouye,"Not personable, actually quite skittish. I had to fire him. Too bad... He had such good ratings.","February 23, 2017",5,5,2,4
Dr. Phil Inouye,"This doctor is highly regarded in the community and received all kind of praises on this website. My overall experience is very different - I saw very little care from him and his staff, which is not surprising considering his practice, is run as a very shrewd business. 
After waiting for over 2 years after my doctor‚Äôs referral, I got my first rendezvous with him. He was attentive while making promises to resolve my situation with long-term abdominal pain. He booked me for colonoscopy even though my last one was fairly recent. 
After colonoscopy and also endoscopy his attitude changed drastically he was no longer caring and practically became dismissive. He was not able to provide me with diagnosis; not exactly gently hinting that I need to loose weight (I am very far from being fat) as well as pushing the pills that I clearly indicated to him were not working for me. He just did not care!
Even though after all expensive tests our last conversation did not provide me with any clues into my condition nor offered me any helpful tips how to manage the pain, I was still hoping that I can at least see him if things get worse. No such luck ‚Äì his door is even more firmly shut than before: no more new referrals for anyone and his existing patients need to go through family doctor first and provide him with paperwork before he considers to see them again. I had been ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù to see him in his office 2 times and was the only person in his waiting room ‚Äì there was nobody else waiting for the appointment (this is with the waiting time of more than 2 years). My conclusion is very simple ‚Äì this doctor is only interested in being paid for expensive procedures (tests, surgeries). He feels no obligation to check on his patients‚Äô condition and will damp you as soon as all tests are done, especially if no expensive surgeries are needed. Considering the lack of specialists in the area, his ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù will continue to thrive while his not so profitable patients continue to suffer.","January 5, 2017",1,1,1,1

Dr. Phil Inouye,"I really lucked out with Dr. Inouye! He was the treating physician in the ER for me about 5 years ago and immediately put me at ease (and made the nurse give me the right amount of painkiller!) I'd had a couple of colonoscopies that didn't exactly leave me jazzed (one of them was with a doctor that made the news...and not in a good way). He knocked me out and when I woke up, it was all over, no residual pain, no bleeding, nothing at all. He admitted me to the hospital and I was nervous about taking steroids to get my UC under control but he took the time to explain everything and reassure me that I wouldn't suffer any long-term effects. He kept me as a patient and I've seen him a couple of times a year since then. Very kind, very knowledgeable, polite, really listens to you...and not hard to look at (that's just a bonus) and his staff are just treasures! Very accommodating, professional but warm and friendly.","May 2, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Phil Inouye,"I am so grateful for this caring and expert gastroenterologist. I have never felt better.

His nurse/receptionist is lovely and kind too.","February 9, 2016",5,5,5,5

His amazing skills stopped the bleeding, repaired the rupture, infused me with fluids, and I was discharged in 10 days. The nurses at the General and the QCH were the best. The ER at QCH not so much. Many thanks to all.","January 6, 2016",5,5,5,5

The reviews accurately reflect how Dr. Hussein works with you. My 16 year old son had been to the hospital 3 times before being referred to Dr. Hussein. What a blessing!!!! Dr. Hussein spent well over an hour when he first saw my son to clearly understand what was going on with him and he took the time to explain everything to my wife and I. Dr. Hussein is a very caring individual and you can be rest assured that he will make all the right decisions to look after your child‚Äôs medical needs. Despite his busy schedule he always makes time to respond to your emails or phone calls. We had to cancel our travel plans this summer because of my son‚Äôs illness and Dr. Hussein took the time to fill out all the paperwork for our insurance company. I felt bad taking time from his busy schedule but really appreciated that he took the time to help us. I can tell you that not many doctors will do this for you these days. Dr. Hussein took the initiative and got us the right help & medical care from other specialists in the hospitals. If it wasn‚Äôt for Dr. Hussein we would still be caught up the medical system and not have the right medical care for our son. He used the latest research, technology and medical evidence when he was treating our son. We really appreciate what Dr. Hussein has done for our son.","August 24, 2016",5,5,5,5

Dr.Hussein is one of the few doctors that I came across that quote the most evidence-based literature when explains our son condition. Dr.Hussein has cared and fought for what's in the best interest of our son. Dr.Hussein always thought out of the box and did not limit his view to the current problem and that's he figured out what's wrong with our son.

I came across Dr Hussein through my best friend as I had visited 6 different doctors in hopes to figure out why my LO wouldn't feed, kept throwing up and loosing weight. Dr Hussein in the first appointment diagnosed the problem correctly and my little guy has been doing great since then! No other doctor was able to help me and kept treating him for the wrong stuff or said it was genetic that he was going to be skinny. 
Absolutely worth the wait to see him because he doesn't rush you on your appointment and answers every question you might have in full detail.

Dr. Terry Moore,"Dr. Terry Moore is the best doctor I have ever had. I was referred to Dr. Moore after seeing two imminent GI specialists in Toronto, having tests done by both, and being told there was nothing wrong. But I was still sick! I had very low expectations that Dr. Moore would find anything new but he reviewed the tests and letters that my family doctor had included in the referral and said ‚ÄúYou have IBS‚Äù. He then drew a picture, upside-down so that I could read it, of what was happening in my body and why I was having all the pain and bloating. He also labelled it upside-down and this may explain why his writing is considered to be so bad. Dr. Moore then gave me a sheet of what I can eat, one of what I can‚Äôt eat, and one of what I have to eat every day. Using these sheets of instructions, I soon had my illness under control. I have been overjoyed to find a doctor that actually believed me, listened to what I said and gave me a diagnosis! Dr. Moore gave me an hour of his time that day and for each follow-up appointment I have had since then. He is always prompt and attentive to his patients. Dr. Moore is a kind man and doctor and, what I would call, a gentleman. He never talks down to me and always listens carefully to everything I have to discuss. His secretary, Bev, is also very kind, caring and efficient. My only problem is that Dr. Moore is retiring in 2015 and will not be there for my next annual appointment. He explained that he loves his work and doesn‚Äôt want to leave but it is a teaching hospital and the newly trained GI specialists with new ideas have to move up the hospital ladder. Dr. Moore is the Best and he will be hard to replace.","May 4, 2015",5,5,5,5
Dr. Terry Moore,"I've been in this man's care for a decade.

If you're in the Barrie midland or orillia area I would recommend her the most due to the fact she's knowledgable and listens and seems to care about getting you well which I feel is a rare find with today's specialists , the receptionist could be a little more personal but that's not Dr. Anands problem .

Dr. Correia was incredibly knowledgeable, especially in the area of decreased motility of the intestinal tract. He had an open and empathetic bedside manner which you really don't find often with specialists. I have a long and colourful medical history, but Dr. Correia listened to everything I had to say and didn't make me feel like a hypochondriac. Chronically ill people are reduced to and defined by their illnesses since they comprise such a vast part of their daily life. Despite this fact, Dr. Correia made me feel heard and asked several times if I had any other questions. How could I when he did such a fantastic job of explaining everything? I wish more specialists would put their egos aside and treat their patients with the kind of dignity and respect I received from Dr. Correia. Most highly recommended!","June 8, 2016",5,5,5,5

Dr. Correia was friendly, welcoming, smiley, and most of all knowledgeable and competent. Before the procedure and after the procedure he clearly explained my personal health issue step by step. When I registered at the Endoscopy Clinic upon my arrival , even the receptionists spoke highly of him. Dr. Correia answered every single concern I had and more. The team work that this physician was working with went above and beyond my expectation-","March 11, 2015",5,5,5,5
Dr. Adriano Correia,"Though polite, and courteoys, Dr Correia fails to listen and discuss concerns. Instead, he just tells you not to worry about it. On 3 occassions he prescribed medication that was extremely dangerous for heart patients. Considering he shares an office with my cardiologist, he's well aware of the fact. I voiced concern over taking the medications, to be met with exasperation from both his receptionist and him. I was made to feel a problem simply because I was informed and cautious. After 4 years, 3 colon Oscoda and 2 endoscopy (he also treats me for a hiatal hernia), NOTHING has been done to help either situation. He's arrogant and if you won't do it his way, regardless of consequences to you, he will make you feel alienated. It's disgusting and illogical to tell a patient to take medications that could potentially kill them. He doesn't care to hear it. Be very wary, and careful if you see him. He's not all sunshine and rainbows as stated. I've heard dozens of complaints. Be warned.","February 21, 2015",3,4,1,1

Dr. Adriano Correia,"After being ill for several years now I have dealt with a plethora of specialists who are not half as special as they think they are. I am constantly amazed at the giant egos and disregard for the patient these doctors display, and then I met Dr. Correia!! Now there was a breath of fresh air. He is young, interested, and eager to listen to you and have you participate in the decision making. He thinks outside the box and is more than willing to try to balance out tests/treatment options with results/further discussions. Also to his credit, he has great warmth, and a sense of humour that cannot be beat. His receptionist Bridget is lovely, and Dr. Correia is a specialist who actually is very special, and the funny part is he does not think he is, probably that humility is what has made him as wonderful as he is.

Dr. Harry Wu,"Did not consider I didn't want to have the procedure done, nor did he take into consideration the financial impact it would have considering I am a single income earner. The procedure I was informed I had to do before the actual procedure would have required me to miss a considerable amount of time from work. Plus my health is fine and I feel the procedure he wanted to perform was unnecessary and I had expressed that I didn't think I needed it done. Did not consider other reasons for my issue, just wanted to book appointment for procedure.

I saw him many times over the past 29 years, and he's always been very open and honest. I've always felt like I was receiving the very best service.

The remind me alot of eachother......","February 23, 2010",5,5,5,5
Dr. Augustine Adesanya,"The best doctor I've ever met. When you first come in, he gets up out of his chair and shakes your hand. You're a human being, not a collection of symptoms attached to a body. You can meet him at the store and he'll remember you and ask how you're doing. I had a condition that was always making me feel like I had the flu. He sent my blood for a test in Texas, and the diagnosis was cryoglobulinemia. That means you're sensitive to the cold. At least now I knew what was triggering these attacks and could develop strategies to avoid them. This is after 30 years of suffering with the condition with one job lost over it and one in jeopardy. Dr. Adesanya could have set up practice anywhere in the world and he chose Timmins because he felt he could do the most good in an under serviced area. A true humanitarian and hero in my book. Sad that he'll be retiring in a few years. What's really sad too, is that he's been harassed by the bureaucrats for ""doing too many tests"". WE NEED MORE LIKE HIM.","January 13, 2010",5,5,5,5

He is easy to talk to and gives you all the time you need. He listens very attentively, examines thoroughly, compassionate, empathetic as he has the same medical problem as me, knowledgable, let's you show emotion if you have to. I can't say enough good about him. I miss you and hope to see you as a patient again soon. Thanks Gus. Appreciate everything.","August 28, 2009",5,4,5,5
Dr. Augustine Adesanya,"He squeezed me in to see him on his lunch break because he knew my case could be urgent and didn't want to make me wait 4 months. I will NEVER ever forget that. He's so thorough and isn't annoyed with having to explain anything to you. If you asked him something obvious like ""What exactly is a stomach?"" I bet you he would still take the time to answer.

He was so compassionate, loving and caring while he took care of me in ICU. This Dr. is so busy; that is why it takes so long to get in to see him, and he works very late hrs, so you can't blame him when he is late. We could surely benefit if all Dr's would follow in his footsteps and treat their patients with respect, compassion and extra-ordinary care. Kudos to you Gus!","April 2, 2008",1,3,5,5

Many Thanks.","August 12, 2007",5,4,5,5
Dr. Augustine Adesanya,"A relatively short wait that's well worth it! Dr. Adesanya has earned my utmost respect- taking time to explain my condition in detail, fully explaining treatment options/suggestions, correcting a clerical booking error to be sure I was seen, and even calling me at home at 9 p.m. one night a few years ago to explain an emergency, last minute test that another doctor had requested- that day! He went out of his way to ensure that my test was done ASAP- only a day after it was requested! He is very thorough (always referring to family history and records from past visits) and efficient- has ALL of your info. ready for your viewing on his large, easy to see computer screen at the touch of a button. His level of care was above and beyond the call of duty with a friend of mine who passed away (from an illness unrelated to his specialty).

No question, have waited multiple hours for him to arrive, but he's worth the wait. Since he's a specialist you don't want to skip an appointment or leave when he's late, it'll take 6-8 months to get another appointment with him.

Dr. Nikila Ravindran,"I have just read the comment posted on 05/06/14. It is impossible that this comment could be about Dr. Ravindran. I wonder about the moderation of the forum on this website, as the same comment appears to have been posted for at least 3 other gastroenterologists at St. Michael's Hospital. I have seen many specialists for my Ulcerative Colitis and have lived with this disease for over 10 years. Dr. Ravindran is one of the most humble, kind, caring and compassionate doctors that I have ever met. She is very knowledgeable, professional and skilled with genuine empathy and a great bedside manner. When I was admitted to the hospital, she spent a great deal of time with me, explaining my test results and treatment options, and helping me arrive at a decision that was best for me. I feel lucky to have been under her care!","July 23, 2014",5,5,5,5

Last Dec I was seen by Dr Khanna although the procedure would be risky he was willing to help me. Finally a professional was willing to help.

The receptionist is amazing.","July 26, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Nitin Khanna,"What an incredible disappointment! I had seen Dr. Khanna for annual checkups for several years, despite not having any pain or problems. Dr. Khanna encouraged me to notify him if any problems did occur and that he would get me in on an urgent basis. However, when I did have one episode where I was in a great deal of pain, his assistant told me that I would have to wait until my regularly scheduled annual appointment- seven weeks later! When I reminded her that I was in a lot of pain, she told me that I was lucky I didn't have to wait longer. When I told him about what happened, Dr. Khanna was not even remotely concerned and backed up his incredibly rude staff assistant.

This is the only clinic i have been to in London for myself and my wife where I have actually seen the doctor at the time my appointment was set for.

I was misdiagnosed repeatedly by other doctors until finally in my mid thirties I was sent to Dr. Khanna who after listening to my story and doing an internal exam diagnosed me with celiac disease.

I went from being extremely ill all the time to being healthy and able to enjoy life again.,"September 24, 2013",5,5,5,5

He scheduled me for a 2nd colonoscopy which I had about 3 weeks ago and he found a fistula. He gave me some medication and has scheduled me for more tests and I will go back to see him next month.

He shows a lot of respect to the patient. His assisting nurse was fantastic as well. I really can't say enough good about this GI. Especially after the bad experiences my father has had with his GI.

They say they will call you back in 6 months for follow up then randomly a year later they just call u and tell you your appointments in a week. She comes and goes as to what your problem is one time its one thing next time its another but she never does the proper investigation seems to shy to look down there.

Dr Oliverira experiments with things she thinks that might work for your problem instead of doing a simple examination to find out the true problem also the ONE nurse I had was extremely rude/ inexperienced I had to cover my self up with the blanket I would avoid OGI at all costs just a waist of time stuck with a problem she cant figure out and having to get another referral to another Doctor,"March 22, 2015",1,1,1,1

Dr. Liliana Oliveira,"L. Oliveira just did a colonoscopy on me and it wasn't very pleasant. Even with sedation the procedure was painful. She told me it wouldn't be like my previous experience at all because I would be heavily sedated. It felt like medical torture because I actually remember what happened unlike my first experience. I left the office feeling very disappointed, violated and livid. I actually felt like an object. She didn't even discuss the findings with me before I left. A nurse just gave me discharge instructions, a prescription, and told to visit a website that I can't access and to book a follow up appointment in 4 months. 
L. Oliveira is a nice doctor with good interpersonal skills but I have no interest in seeing her or any other gastroenterologist again. I will never ever agree to do another colonoscopy again. 
Now I know why I was very reluctant to do the procedure.","February 7, 2015",5,4,3,5

He has displayed great patience to the many questions I have asked, and was one of the only people who took my problems seriously rather then dismissing them as being temporary because I was considered on the young side for the types of problems I have been experiencing. The only issue I have it that it takes several months to get in to see him, but after being dismissed by so many doctors I rather wait then be ignored.","May 10, 2013",4,4,4,5
Dr. William McMullen,Worst Dr I have ever seen! He subjected me to the most painful colonoscopy I have evre had and then put me on mediation for ulcertive colitis that was useless. Then he prescribed another oral medicaa on and enemas for five months that did nothing to help the colitis and the pain and horrible diarria. When I did get to see him his response was to keep going with the meds and it eventually wouls help. I was referred to another gastroenderolist who told me I was on the wrong meds and not even the right doseage.

Dr. Navaaz Saloojee,"There are so many good reviews about this Doctor but my experience with him leaves a lot to be desired.
I went to see him with MAJOR GI problems. Severe Constipation or Diarrhea, enormous stomach pains coming from all over, when I pooped or passed gas I would be left with a piece of Colon hanging outside of me, constant burping regurgitation to the point where I would go into heavy dry heaving fits after eating or start projectile vomiting, a lot of food was going through me undigested, etc
His first suggestion was to take 2mg Prucalopride every day as well as Senna and Restoralax twice a day.
I stressed that I am pooping out a big piece of my Colon every time and had to constantly push it back up inside of me.... he just stared at me.
I told him I have to manually pump my stomach when I'm having a Bowel Movement - he just stared at me.
I know these things are not normal. Why are you not doing any Testing on me to figure out what is wrong? 
Well, what would you like me to do?
I said I want to see why I am having so much trouble pooping. Can you not order a Test that will show what happens when I try to Poop and how things move through me? 
Sure, a Proctograph and the Colonic Transit Study. He explained what both of them were then I asked him to order them. He said OK but I want to see what 2mg of Prucalopride does for you first. So take 2mg during the Tests and keep it up till I see you again.
I do the Tests - Proctograph shows External Rectal Prolapse.
A week later he calls back and tells me about the Rectal Prolapse and then tells me that he is referring me to a ColoRectal Specialist and he would see me again in six months.
I told him about the unpleasant things that Prucalopride was doing to me. He said that is a matter tier the ColoRectal Specialist and to wait six months till I see them. In the meantime keep taking the Prucalopride. A lot of people have a bad first month on it.
Six months later things are much worse. ColoRectal Specialist refers me to a Physiotherapist to see if Rectal Prolapse Surgery would even work for me. Due to what the Prucalopride has done to me I have such extreme IBS that at the end of the first month my Physiotherapist wants me to stop because it's not helping.
Go back to ColoRectal Surgeon. She says that Prolapse Surgery won't work for you right now. I think you should stop taking the Prucalopride? How long were you taking it? Were you taking it during the Sitz Marker Study? You were? Ok, you weren't supposed to. Who told you to tajes that? Dr Saloojee did? He's usually spot on with most of this so that surprises me. You're going to need to take the Test again.
I go back to Dr Saloojee because my burping, Reflux, regurgitation, dry heaving and puking has got MUCH worse. He puts he on 60mg of Rabeprazole and sends me for a Barium Swallow. 
The Barium Swallow shows a Hiatus Hernia and severe GERD.
After the Barium Swallow they gave me some sort of stupid strong Laxative. This not only got me to empty out ALL of the Barium the next day but destroyed my Stomach. A week later it's still like I've got a crazy Flu. Puking and Diarthea like crazy whenever I tried to eat anything.
I call Dr Saloojee back and he said that it is because of how inflamed everything is. That it should die down and to keep taking the Rabeprazole at 60mg. This is still the same two weeks later when I have another Appointment with my ColoRectal Surgeon. I told het what's been going on. She said that I should talk to my GI about it. I told her I already have and that he has been less than helpful.
She asked if he at least ordered the Full Follow Through for the Small Bowel as part of the Barium Swallow? No???
Well he didnt Order that Test right either. That I'm going to have to do it again. He should have known better that if he's sent somebody to a ColoRectal Surgeon and then sends them for a Barium Swallow that he needs to do the whole thing.
However, right now you are too sick to be doing Testing. I'm going to have to put this all on hold till things improve so I can Test you.
I call up Dr Saloojee.... he decided that the Rabelrazole wasn't strong enough so put me on Nexium 60mg for a week. Things decline more than 50%. I call him back and he changes Meds to Prevacid 60mg. I take that for a week and things keep declining. I'm having between 12-20 loose bowel Movements a day and pooping the fed at night.
I call him back and this time he says that I have extreme IBS. That there is nothing that he can do. Tells me to pick up some Imodium OTC (which isn't helping at all) and to get some Buscopan OTC.
I get somebody to go to the Drug Store for me. They got the Imodium. Then they are told that Buscopan is available OTC but almost nobody carries it. They have it by Prescription and there are other Antispasmodics as well.","Submitted May 10, 2017",5,1,1,1

Dr. Sharif B. Missiha,This guy shouldn't be allowed to practice medicine. No people skills. He treats his staff at the hospital horrible. I had him booked for a colonoscopy was late due to my illness and he yelled at me before putting me sleep. I was so nervous about the procedure and for a doctor to treat a patient like that he needs to be flipping burgers instead,"June 23, 2017",1,1,1,1
Dr. Sharif B. Missiha,"His staff is great, punctuality is fine, I'm sure he is knowledgeable in his field, but dr missiha is the rudest, and most arrogant doctors I have ever visited. He would not even take the time to listen to me when asking me a question. Not a good experience with dr at all.","June 3, 2017",5,4,1,3
Dr. Sharif B. Missiha,"It has been a year now since I first met Dr. Sharif B. Missiha. He said I drank a lot of alcohol. I did not think so or did I believe him. I actually was not pleased after my first visit but thought it was best I hear him out because he was very down to earth. He went over all my previous history off blood work that showed I was on a path to a place I did not want to be. He was correct, I had a problem. If you think you may have a drinking problem this is the doctor to see. He got me turned around and a year later I am happy to say I am one very happy, feel great and a healthy person. Thanks Dr. Sharif B. Missiha. Also kudos to the reception/office manager. Sorry, I can't remember your name (Melissa?), but you were awesome as well.","May 19, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Sharif B. Missiha,"I am a male, 56 years of age. After having avoided the dreaded Colonoscopy for 6 years past when I was supposed to have it done, I finally relented and went for it. I had no experience with this at all. No idea who to use. So, I looked here to see who everyone was using. Dr Missiha had great reviews. I requested him. Thank god! i can't comment on other Dr's as I didn't see them. I'm sure they are all fine. However, Dr M was great. Please, don't believe any negative reviews on here about this man. He is knowledgeable, very very friendly, and makes you feel at ease (and I have to admit it, I was pretty nervous.)

Dr. Dan Kottachchi,"My mother was a patient of Dr. Kottachchi's for the past 5 years, he placed her feeding tube which was required due to Scleroderma affecting her GI tract. Dr. K's bedside manner with my Mom was of great comfort to her as he went above and beyond to address her concerns regarding her condition. My Mom's medical condition was very complex and he still managed to give her a very high quality of life regardless. More recently when she was in palliative care he still took the time to call her (while out of the city) to help deal with complications with her tube and co-ordinate a solution with her palliative Dr. As the daughter managing my Mom's medical affairs I found Dr. K to be very open to research & suggestions that I brought to the table. He was not condescending or offended as I have found other doctors to be. I would highly recommend Dr. Kottachchi he is a very kind, compassionate and empathetic gastroenterologist. My mother trusted him completely and found him to be of great comfort to her particularly when she was actually staying in the hospital.","July 26, 2017",4,4,5,5
Dr. Dan Kottachchi,Dr. Kottachchi has been treating me for Crohn's Disease for the past year and has been fantastic. Not only is he extremely knowledgeable but I've also found him to be very open to my own suggestions regarding options for treatments. He has also personally called me on multiple occasions. I have been treated with respect as a individual and have never felt like another case file. Would definitely recommend him.,"July 25, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Dan Kottachchi,"I saw Dr. Kottachchi in the spring of 2014. He was incredibly arrogant and had zero bed side manner and zero compassion. I felt like he took it as a personal insult that I had asked for a second opinion in my condition. He did however visit me in the hospital everyday for 2 weeks to personally monitor my situation and kept in close contact thereafter. Overall, I would not recommend him as a doctor.","July 3, 2017",5,3,1,3
Dr. Dan Kottachchi,I saw Dr Kottachchi myself on two occasions both times extremely helpful and got to the root of the problem. However the most praise I have for him is that he was the only Doctor who diagnosed my fathers esophageal cancer. He was also the only doctor that gave us a real prognosis and allowed us to start coming to terms with the diagnosis. He was very apologetic that he had not been told to see my father sooner and even called my house to speak with my parents. Great doctor wouldn't go to anyone else.,"May 1, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Dan Kottachchi,"I can't say how happy I am that I ended up seeing Dr. Kottachchi. I felt heard for the first time in years. He is very compassionate, very professional, and was willing to speak to me at my level of intelligence which I very much appreciated (i.e. it didn't offend his ego that I happened to know a few things about my own body/condition). I left his office with a feeling of hope - even though there aren't many options for my condition - because I have finally been treated like a human being by a medical professional. I truly appreciate his kind, professional, caring nature and commitment to expanding his knowledge to the forefront of medical research. He has taken very good care of me both in his office and in surgery.","January 24, 2017",4,5,5,5

Dr. Peter Campbell,"I was taken to the ER at Lakeridge with so much bleeding I needed 2 units of blood. The same thing had happened 8 months prior and a year ago at the same hospital but no one seemed to care. He was very brusque, didn't listen or care about my history with recurrent heavy bleeding, and blamed me for not seeking treatment (Even though it was because of dismissive doctors like him that I continued to bleed every 6 months. His colleagues at the hospital never wanted to treat me, they wanted to discharge me ASAP). Poor bed side manner and an abysmal hospital.","September 1, 2017",1,1,2,2

Dr. Peter Campbell,I was misdiagnosed with IBS and Dr. Campbell listened very carefully to all my symptoms which is something no other doctor had done at that point. He then concluded that it was highly probable that I had something else which he prescribed a medication that changed my life within 24 hrs of starting. I have since been able to ween myself off and live a normal pain free life.,"December 15, 2015",4,5,5,5
Dr. Peter Campbell,"Doctor Campbell has been extremely knowledgeable in dealing diseases of the bowel as I understand from several of his patients. I believe outside of diseases of the bowel, he is ignorant in addressing important matters with respect to his patients wellness. He has personal issues that cloud his judgement and though his patients will refer to him as compassionate, he is actually weak and does his patients no good by feeling sorry for them where he should be more realistic in supporting disability claims. He has poor judgement as a medical professional outside of the scope of bowel disease as evidenced in his own personal dealings which impairs his ability to endorse a patient's ability or inability to function. You've come to the right doctor if you want someone to feel sorry for you and cut you open to support your disability claim. You've come to the wrong doctor if you want to get better and live a semi normal life. This is not just my personal experience but my observation of other patients as well.","September 3, 2015",3,3,1,1

He has had a great deal of misery in the last couple of years yet he still treats me exactly the same as he did before those issues arose. His staff are first rate always cheerful and helpful. I still have all my bowl and my disease is managable and never was until I went to dr Campbell. Every person that I recommend to him thanks me.

I think that some of the people that have negative things to say may look at the circumstances. This man has been through more then any one person can imagine. He still treats my family like we are all number one. I almost died on the table from a doctor like some people have described in their comments. This man has so much compassion for every single person in my family. We have had several visits between all of us for over 10 years and have not one negative thing to say.

Im a young man who had a polyp and his reaction was less than professional. So here i am a couple mins. after the procedure, half gorked still from the meds., and he tells me ""wow, your intestines are 30 years older then they should be"". ""We found a large polyp...I removed it...bye!"". I said WHAT!? That was it. CANCER? Thats all he said to me. I WAS SHOCKED. Despite the nurses trying to kick me out, as ""MY TIME"" was up, I stayed to speak with Doc. Campbell again. I asked him what would have happened if i came to see him in 20 years. HIs answer.

Even though I live in Windsor, we travel to London for all of my checkups and any time I get sick, because being under his care I feel safe and I KNOW I will get better!

Our dr. has tried to reach him 3 times and he still hasn't had the professional courtesy to return a call. I was hoping going this far that I was see the best....so NOT the case,"December 13, 2009",1,5,1,1

When my son was in the hospital in London several times if Dr. Howard wasn't able to see him on a particular day he would make a point of calling his hospital room that night to check up on him.

Dr. Scott Shulman,"My grandpa recently had a near death experience and was rushed to the emergency department after the stent in his liver became infected, shortly following his diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. It was a crushing experience for my entire family as we were told to say our goodbyes as he would not make it through the night. 
It was after midnight when the physician on duty sent a text to Dr. Shulman to see if he was awake and could assist in any way. To our greatest relief, Dr. Shulman texted back informing he would come in first thing in the morning (unscheduled) to perform a surgery that could have the chance of prolonging my grandpa's life. The surgery was successful and my grandpa is now at home happily living out the rest of his days.
I can't thank Dr. Shulman enough for going out of his way to prolong my grandpa's life. My family is forever grateful that my grandpa was in the hands of such a caring compassionate man and we will forever feel fortunate for the days we have gained.","March 5, 2017",5,5,5,5

I like this Dr. He is patient, he listens and he is very smart. He is everything my General MD is not. This Dr. takes me and my stomach issue seriously, not like my General MD. I read good things about Dr. Shulman on here months before going to see him (he's hard to get in to see, but he is apparently the best at what he does) and I have to agree with everything I read on here about him. Excellent bedside manner, he is quick to joke and make you feel very at ease around him. I loved my first experience with him. He asks questions and listens. That's what a ""real"" good Dr. should be! The Devil is in the details, so they should be good listeners. Not ""talk over you"" and act like a know it all, or God, like my General MD does. He even agreed with some of my assessment of my problem and agreed to look into that and do some other stuff while doing a upper GI scope. That's what I like to hear, thorough examination! Be a Sherlock Holmes I say and find the problem through process of elimination. Might as well, if you are already in there right? Why can't all Dr.'s be this good? Effecient. Oh, right, someone had to graduate last in Med School. I can tell you this Dr. was not that ""last to pass"", student. On the contrary, he was probably tops out of Med School. He is very knowledgable and has a really good head on his shoulders I think. He even knows some history of Gastroentorology. I liked chatting with him. Too bad he only has such limited time for patients. I could have stayed there and talked his ear off and enjoyed it. Great guy!

The secretaries are NOT drs and I have seen many patients expect the secretaries to answer questions they aren't allowed to and then get upset and write nasty things about them. The other problem about these sites is that anybody can write anything they want, for example, you get mad and you want your ""revenge""... you also get your friend who, by the way has never been in the office, write something nasty about the secretary. The secretary works for the dr. the secretary does what the dr. tells her/him. It is not up to the patient to becon or demand things from the secretary.

Dr. Rossos is a specialist in his field...today in Ontario it is difficult just to get top see a specialist, so for me to have the priviledge to see someone of his trainning, knowledge and consideration for his patients is worth every second of wait.

First off, I never got the chsnce to see this stupid dr. 
I spent 6 hrs in emerg only to find out that they ""couldn't"" do anything for me and had to refer me to a Dr to check me out. 
So here's what happened. 
First off, I got a call 2 weeks AFTER my visit in emerg for the appointment. Only to have them tell me it was booked for mid may, more than a month and a half AFTER my visit to emerg. It's a good thing that what was going on with me wasn't life threatening because I'd be dead by then. 
I had SPECIFICALLY told the emergency room Dr that I could NOT do an appt before 11 am because I am a single parent who doesn't drive and I have to drop my daughter off at school for 9 am. So it would take me OVER an hr to get to the hospital from where I am and I have to drop my daughter off at school for 9 am so I needed time for transfer and such. He explained he would write that oncane referral and he did, as he had shown me BEFORE the referral was faxed over. 
I got a call from Dr. Bashirs office about 2-3 weeks later, and they told me my appointment (in the voicemail) would in MID MAY (wtf???) at the hospital for 8:30 am and I had to be there at 7:30!!!! ARE THESE IDIOTS DAFT!!!!????? I KNOW what the referral said. And the printing was VERY clear on it. 
So I call them back to tell them A) to cancel the stupid appointment because NOW I didn't need it any more and B) to give then shit for not following simple f***ing instructions.
Here's the best part. I've been calling them all morning(14 times nkw) to try to do all this and I can't get through. There's no voicemail and apparently the o KY have one line. The first time o called this morning she put me on hold for over 3 min. I'm sorry but I don't have that kind of time. I already have another idea appointment to go.to this morning. 
I am SICK of the drs here in Canada NOT LISTENING TO THE PATIENT!!! And the fact that the emergency rok..doesn't have a scope to put down patients throat to find out what's going on? That's a bunch of bs. 
It's now 45 min later and I STILL can't get through. Lol. I dont give a crsp how ""good"" a dr is, theyre shit if they dont have an answering maching their pateints csn leave a messagenin EVEN DURING BUSINESS HOURS!!!! His office is a joke!","April 18, 2016",1,1,1,1

He has the tools and the know-how to fully treat your pain issues. I have lower back injuries, chronic migraines and severe nerve damage throughout my body. He has been able to utilize an array of different techniques and tools to lower my pain immensely. He doesn't push one treatment over another just for the sake of a kickback like other doctors may. He is understanding and listens to your needs without talking over you. I would go to no other physician than himself. On top of his expertise he also has a great staff working for him. They are on the ball and always helpful with follow up calls on days after procedures. You can't get it any better than at South Bay Pain Docs.

And then when I was done, he did not come see me at all to explain what went right or what he could see. I did not see him AT ALL. The nurses rushed me out of the recovery room so quickly and I was still so disoriented that they basically shoved me out of there. Only to find out that he wants to see me in four weeks?!

I went for a follow up appointment with him today and after discussing his findings I talked to him a little about some other health issues I was having and the difficulty I was having getting the help I need from my family doctor and another specialist. They won't even order the labs I need. Even though this was not in his area of expertise he ordered all of the labs I wanted and said that he didn't know why everyone was being so difficult.

I had an experience in Dr hewaks office with a simple scope. During the procedure he punctured my bowel, and although I know the chances of this happening is 1 in 10000, it happened to me. What I don't understand is that when I awoke Dr. Hewak told me he had punctured my bowel. I don't remember much after that except that I was sent to emergency not in an ambulance but by car driven by my spouse. Thats all I remember of the experience except that I had the Hartman procedure and ended up on breathing machines three times in the next 6 months. Remember patients doctors make mistakes, but when its your life ask all the right questions before the procedure especially if you are considered an emergency after a procedure.

It took 2 months to connect successfully with his office to get an appointment. Full mailbox every day. Can't leave a message. No one will answer the phone live. I've never experienced that before. As such, the abscess in his abdomen has been growing for two more months. Dr. Grover is amazing, but an inability to see him (especially after a test) means the results don't get reviewed in a timely fashion. It's a problem. A great doctor blocked by a bad office admin. My husband's condition could result in a surgery now, which wouldn't have been necessary had he found out 2 months ago that his abscess was not gone. The treatment could have been continued instead of ended for two months. Really hoping Dr. Grover can find some office support to reflect how well he treats his patients.","November 10, 2016",1,4,4,5

I was told I needed to have an appointment this fall prior to my procedure early in the New Year. The procedure was booked and I received a written notice but the fall appointment was not made and I cannot reach the secretary to request she make the appointment.

Dr. Leslie Lilly,"I had a liver transplant at Toronto General. Dr. Lilly was in charge of the liver transplant team. I can't express how grateful I am. He saved my life and though it was everything to me, to him it was just another day at the office. He takes it for granted that he will do everything possible to save your life. And he'll do it with compassion, kindness and a sense of humour. He is one of the best doctors ever, not just in his specialty but ever. If something is outside his specialty, he makes sure you see a specialist connected to the transplant unit; and they have specialists for almost everything. He's not averse to admitting that there may be a more qualified doctor, unlike many doctors I've met 
After 6 years, my liver got diseased. I went to 2 hospitals, and they both misdiagnosed it. Fortunately, I had an appointment with Dr. Lilly, who diagnosed it and immediately put me on the transplant list. The entire hospital was stunned. ""This never happens"", they said. They kept me in the hospital to wait for a new liver. There were specific requirements because of my previous transplant. When a liver became available, one of Dr. Lilly's surgeons went, personally, to excise the liver. On his day off. This is how dedicated Dr. Lilly's team is.
I have nothing but praise for Dr. Lilly, Brenda (my coordinator), his team and Toronto General. If you want to live, go to Toronto General","April 27, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Leslie Lilly,"I used to think Dr. Lilly was a great doctor. He was my mother's doctor for 17 years. Considering the amount of years he has been a Gastroenterologist, he should know what he is doing. Apparently not! Our mother wasn't monitored regularly for cancer considering Cyclosporine is the major reason why transplanted patients demise from cancer. Regular monitoring should be conducted on every patient who has undergone organ transplantation. Apparently, that wasn't the case. Our mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma of the unknown primary in July 2015 and Dr. Lilly was no where to be seen throughout all the hospitalization our mother had undergone in the last 6 months after being diagnosed up until the last few days of her life. It appears the cancer originated from the 1st liver they had transplanted diagnosed as HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) but never monitored properly which manifested to a secondary cancer which wasn't found (hence why they diagnosed her with Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary). We are having this matter investigated since our mother's demise in early 2016 regarding being misdiagnosed and not properly monitored. 
After all the years our mother and has have trusted Dr. Lilly, he has proven to be a terrible doctor with no sympathy or care. He had reports and knowledge of everything our mother was going through and he didn't intervene and try to help. Our mother was misdiagnosed for 6 months at Toronto General Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital which Dr. Lilly was fully aware of and Dr. Lilly didn't help. BE CAREFUL!!!! I don't wish to scare you or deter you from your main source of organ doctor and coordinator but make sure YOU insist on getting checked regularly for cancer. I have another friend who has undergone a liver transplant and is now diagnosed with cancer. God Bless you all!","November 4, 2016",1,1,1,1

We live in Northern Ontario and he corresponds with the doctors here to co-ordinate my husband's care. Dr. Lilly is a doctor that goes over and beyond the expectations of what we have seen with other doctors. Jeff, his co-ordinator is wonderful and always willing to answer questions or get answers from Dr. Lilly. On occasion you have to wait awhile to see him, but this is due to his care in taking care of other patients. Emergencies happen and unforeseen problems are dealt with, which sometimes causes a delay in him getting to his appointments. The wait is worth it because of the exceptional care we get.

Dr. Leslie Lilly,"Dr Leslie Lilly, what can I say? Him and his staff refuse to return a phone call... ultimately prolonged his patient of getting on the transplant list, and refused to treat or see his patient of liver disease until he was admitted on the transplant list. Well, safe to say he watched his patient come in totally healthy and ready for a transplant, with a donor who was a match and willing to operate asap, dwindle down only to die 8 months later, not once making a return phone call to other physicians with questions, or to his own patient on numerous occasions. From my experience he is a coward that hides behind his secretaries, and clearly did not take the time to follow up with his patient to advise him during the hardest moments of his life. We lost a great man, who may as well have been alive today if it wasn't for Dr Lilly's lack of urgency. Disappointing.","Submitted May 7, 2014",1,1,1,2

Dr. Leslie Lilly,"Dr. Lilly is amazing. Kind, honest, intelligent and personable. Would not have survived liver disease and liver transplant without him. I am SHOCKED anyone would find him rude. Unless he had to leave a consultation/clinic appointment, due to being needed for surgery/emergency...which is very possible due to the fact that when an organ is available for transplant...there is NO waiting. I would think people rating Dr.'s that perform surgery on wait-times would take into consideration that our health care based on a triage system, not on a first-come-first-serve basis. Those who are the most ill and in dire need get seen first. That means procedures that aren't life-saving sometimes incur a longer wait period.

Dr. Gabor Kandel,"Seems caring initially but does not listen to patient symptoms, and concerns. He gets an idea in his head and sticks with it regardless of symptoms even when symptoms do not match what he thinks you have. He seems to have gotten stuck and will not learn anything new. Even when you express that the treatment is not working or leaves you feeling worse, he will insist you keep with it as if you didn't even mention that it was causing difficulty or problems. Also when in conversation the diagnosis will change in seconds during the same breath and when you question it to clarify it will change again. Perhaps he has too much on his plate but its left me in a world of trouble in terms of now having to go through other tests and specialists because nothing has been consistent. What's worse is if I don't get proper treatment for this disorder that I have all the symptoms for and that he confirmed (before changing his mind in the last follow up letter without any cause) or use the treatment plan he suggested I can end up with a blockage or very ill. I am so lost and now don't know where to go from here :( I think he simply confuses patients charts and has too many patients on his roster to provide consistent care.","August 11, 2017",3,3,1,2

Dr. Gabor Kandel,"I usually only read this site, but just had to post about Dr Kandel as I think he's the most wonderful dr. He was my doctor when I was sick at 15 years of age, and then I returned 10 years later for a follow up and he remembered me. That just amazed me as he must see so many patients a day. He's always been compasionate and caring and understands how stomach issues affect everyday life and always wanted to make sure that you can still enjoy life. I'm actually shocked at the one negative post below as he always ensured that I keep in touch by phone or email to let him know how I'm doing (rather than dragging me in for another appointment) and always responded. As a teenager, it was very scary being sick and he made the situation as least scary as possible. He didn't jump to surgery and will try other means first (which I appreciated). I recommend Dr Kandel to anyone who is having stomach issues.","March 19, 2008",5,4,5,5
Dr. Gabor Kandel,"Dr. Kandel is a true credit to Ontario‚Äôs heath care system. He made time for me in his very busy schedule about a common GI issue which was causing me pain and I thought was serious. Yet, he did not make me feel like my ailment was trivial and he made me feel like a person and not a nuisance nor another OHIP number. In addition to examining me, he actually sat down and asked me how I was feeling and if my ailment was affecting my work. In addition, he is incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to explain my situation to me and my options for treatment - starting with the most conservative. A true gem of a doctor - not only a talented doctor but also a gentleman and a humanitarian.","February 24, 2008",5,5,5,5
Dr. Gabor Kandel,"My husband has been a patient of Dr. Kandel's for several years. We have always found Dr. Kandel to be compassionate and extremely knowledgeable. He always returns our phone calls even if it's in the evening, and has fit my husband in at the last minute when his case was of an urgent concern. We never found him to be pushy when it comes to surgery -- if anything, he'd rather try other avenues before subjecting a patient to an operation. A true gem of a doctor. A very kind man -- just the type of person who want to deal with when you're in such a painful situation.","September 11, 2007",5,5,5,5

Dr. Kandel has a very good reputation in the medical community and at the University of Toronto. His success lies in surgical procedures. But for those who are not very eager to wear a bag for 6 months, then stay away. His methods sometimes lack sensibility, knowledge and helpfulness. He is also not very empathic at times. His patients feel like they have no other choice because he is one of the most well known specialists in his field. He can help, but he is not the only solution.","April 13, 2007","Staff

He asked every question under the sun to find out what was causing my pain; which in turn caused me to be more active in my health. He was very conseravtive with invasive tests, which he said may not be necessary at my young age. He fit me in for evening appointments, when most doctors generally would not see people.

Dr. David Moscowitch,I am very pleased with my experience with Dr. Moskovitz. From the referral time to meeting him at the office everything was done very efficiently and professionally. His office staff is now great. They are very friendly and very helpful. They were able to answer all of my questions even before the appointment. They walked me through the procedures I had to have and I was not nervous at all. As for Dr. Moskovitz I completely agree with everything that has been said. He really treats you like a real person. You can easily sense that he cares and that he is compassionate. I feel that he really tries to get to know you and this has helped me work through my issues. Despite now having to battle a chronic illness I feel that I have complete support and can ask Dr. Moskovitz and his team really anything. If you have any issues this is the office to deal with as they will make you feel at ease and give you your life back.,"July 15, 2017",5,5,5,5

I recommend Dr. Moskovitz for any stomach or bowel related issues.","March 14, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. David Moscowitch,"I'm very disappointed with this doctor and his office. I've been seeing him for about 2 years and my condition is getting worse. The doctor doesn't care at all. He sees patients for 5 min, not explaining anything, speaking too fast. Giving prescriptions and next appointment after 3 months. I tried calling many times to set up earlier appointment. I could never speak with a receptionist. No one would return my calls or e-mails. It takes them several days to return my calls only to tell me that the next available appointment is after 1, 2 or 3 months. Yes, I would take it if I'm alive by then. So unprofessional, no care for the patient at all. I'm changing this doctor and wouldn't recommend him to anyone. For two years, after taking these so expensive pills, I ended up being twice more sick.","March 14, 2017",1,4,1,2

Dr. David Moscowitch,"I was recently referred to Dr. David ""Moskovitz"", by my Primary Care Physician and felt compelled after reading the last patients assessment of his services, to relay in part my own experience.
Sadly, to see that the previous patient cannot distinguish between Specialists with same name but different spellings is quite telling in my opinion. I was referred to Dr. Moskovitz in early August of 2015. When I called to confirm my appointment, I was greeted in a very professional fashion. I was given instruction as to those things that would be needed prior to my arrival, and was also given courtesy instruction regarding Dr. Moskovitz recent relocation. As I lived in Toronto for some time, I knew that there may be some difficulty in finding parking and therefore I did my research beforehand. 
On the date of my appointment, I made sure to get to that part of the city with enough time to ensure parking and walk time if necessary. It wasn't without some difficulty, but I took it in stride. I arrived at my appointment approximately 20 minutes early. I was very impressed with the office location and set up. A very upbeat contemporary design, that immediately put me at ease. His staff greeted me upon my arrival and were not only kind, but I found them to be very professional. They took my information, and stated that the Doctor would be with me as soon as possible. Again, the office was beautiful and I felt very comfortable. Dr. Moskovitz came from his office and called me within moments of my scheduled appointment and took me to his office where my medical history, treatment options and specialty care follow ups were discussed to my total satisfaction.
I find it unfortunate that there are those that have poor experiences with medical professionals, but often wonder how that experience could have been improved with some added effort on their part.
I for one felt it a privilege to be seen as quickly as I was, by I am told a leading member of this cities specialty group. My thanks to Dr. Moskovitz and his team. I for one am very grateful for his efforts and treatment on my part.","November 25, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. David Moscowitch,"They have a toll free number that they never pick up. I was running late, called 5 times and it went to the recorded message. 1040 being the address, the location is off by a block and accross, they should advise you of this when scheduling you as its a major issue in finding the office unless you live on that street. Spoke with the receptionist who gave me an awkward look when I told her I was late for the appointment as if I had a meeting with God himself. Told her it took me 20 mins to fund the address and the traffic didn't help, she said she would confirm if the doctor would see me. Fine... I waited for 10 minutes before I went up again to confirm (absolute lack of courtesy). Receptionist there says it will be a bit, I asked can you tell me approximately how long since I have a 3 yr old with me, she doesn't know and that my turn would be when someone else was late. 
Train your staff to be polite and courteous. No favors done here, your office gets paid for seeing patients, staff should have professional and helpful tone in assisting patients. It took me 45 mins to get to his office, find a parking in the mid zone of construction and single lanes traffic. 
Note to patients: doctors are servants of the public, paid for by govt of Ontario. Register your complaints at the college of physicians when you are I'll treated.","Submitted November 23, 2016",1,1,1,1

Dr. Houssein Fergani,I recieved a leaflet in the mail for after 50 screening for Colon Cancer and had put it off for years. I was experiencing off on severe pain under right ribs. Family Dr. referred me to Dr. Fergani. My Colonoscopy and Endoscopy went well. No problems whatsoever. Tge receptionists and the nurse in prep. and recovery was very pleasant and the nurses who were in the procedure room were also pleasant. Dr. Fergani is just like some machine. Hello! In and out he goes. After procedure you get most of your results unless he does biopsy. My results came back with an bacterial infection in my stomach. I went in to see the Dr. and once again rushed. I could not ask too many questions as he is a Dr. that gives short answers and makes you feel like you know nothing. He said you can treat it with antibiotics and its no big deal. I got my medication and was shocked to see the package I got 8 pills a day for 7 days. Strong medication. I will not return to a Dr. who walks out while you are asking questions. Do your research. If you are a person that likes to ask questions he is not the Dr. to go to as the practise is fast paced and he will not make the time.,"December 5, 2016",5,3,1,1
Dr. Houssein Fergani,"I found Dr. Fergani and his staff to be helpful and professional. My biggest concern was the prep. I had heard in the past that the purgative tasted awful. Now, you have a choice of liquids to drink and a small amount of purgative. The day of , everything was on time, two hrs. start to finish. Unfortunately, I get migraines and not eating is a trigger. On recovery, I still had the migraine. Usually the sedative given relieves the headache. Just before you leave, the nurse discusses your report , you get a copy and they make sure you meet your ride .","November 21, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Houssein Fergani,"Dr. Fergani puts his pride before his patients. I had a simple case of ibs. I had concerned that it could be a case of SIBO. Something that was brought to my attention by a user on a support site which was given to me by the endoscopy center in the first place. He was outraged that I would even ask. Angrily shoves the form in my face and says ""if I don't give out this test you will keep coming"" I can't even describe how condescending and rude he was to me in one of the most vulnerable times in my life. I took the test and it was negative. I went to another city because I didn't trust the results. Sure enough I was positive and my condition was treatable with a simple course of antibiotics.","October 26, 2016",5,5,1,3

Dr. Houssein Fergani,"I had my endoscopy and colonoscopy a few days ago. It went well ( at least I assume so because I woke up and it was all over lol ) I was taken in very close to my actual appointment time, checked in, given 2 gowns to wear ( one opens in the front and one opens in the back ), pre-op workup done, IV readied, both procedures done and recovered all within 3 hours. I came home and slept for the rest of the day. I don't remember much about the rest of my day at all. 2 days later I have some discomfort in my upper to mid back which is normal I'm told. I am hoping within a few more days it goes away. The staff is wonderful, Dr. Fergani is very pleasant and efficient. They have a great setup there. Perhaps if I have any complaints ( and I'm sort of reaching here ) it would be to include more of the possible after effects from the endoscopy. I have a bit of discomfort in my mid to upper back that I wasn't expecting. After speaking with the staff I understand this is normal and can last for a few days following. I will patiently wait until next week before I get concerned. All in all , not as bad as I imagined it would be.","May 13, 2016",5,4,5,5

Dr. Houssein Fergani,"After seeing my doctor for persistent constipation and bleeding, she referred me to Dr Fergani for a colonoscopy and endoscope (persistent iron deficiency). He took my concerns seriously, despite being only 40 and booked me for testing at the James Street clinic the following week. One second I was awake, and the next second I was out. It felt like I hadn't even gone in yet, but my tests were over. I was kept longer in recovery because he wanted to speak with my husband about his findings. He removed 2 one cm polyps, but had also found the source of my problem: a 5x4 cm tumour. He had taken a biopsy and would be sending everything for testing asap. He discussed what would happen next: if possible, he would remove it via colonoscopy at the hospital because there is a possibility that it would require surgery and a ressection if anything unusual occured during the removal. Biopsy results were in the following week and he had booked me for a sigmoidoscoy. Biopsy results confirmed tubulovillous cells, not yet malignant. Surgery went well as did both follow up appts. He even personally called to check in on me after each procedure. Although rare in someone my age, catching it at its size, and premalignancy saved me from a rather bleak prognosis-permanent colostomy bag if it had gotten any larger, and potential metastatic lung and liver cancer had I waited even a year longer, or if my GP had dismissed me with IBS and not made this referral. His team is top notch, and he is very informative, proactive, and a fabulous Dr. Many specialists won't even entertain a referral for someone my age. Dr. Fergani recommended my siblings also be tested. My sister had to push tne issue to even be considered, and only with a full disclosure from myself, would he even consider her. Fortunately, I received very clear and concise documentation to provide her physician.","October 1, 2014",5,4,5,5
Dr. Houssein Fergani,I was very nervous about going here and getting a colonoscopy but the nurses were very nice and made me felt at ease. The prep work was the worst of it all. The packets you get from the drugstore are orange flavor and taste gross. Thank god I didnt have to drink alot of it. I bought 4 bottles of the Powerade Grape-strawberry and that helped me throughout the day. But once I was at the clinic it felt like a real hospital and very professional. And yes you get put out.. No feeling... your talking one min and its done. Then your walking out the door for your ride home. So people its no sweat.. Im writing this the day after and I feel fine. I slept most of the day yesterday but its because I was so nervous the night before and I got no sleep. I hope this helps.,"May 2, 2014",5,4,5,5
Dr. Houssein Fergani,"Dr. Fergani has a nice bedside manner, however I can't help but feel like the patient doesn't really matter. I needed an upper scope for a problem and he took almost 1.5 years (yes you read that correctly) to have it booked through his office. His office did say that he could do both scopes-- upper endoscopy and colonoscopy within a couple of weeks if I decided to do that. I had no lower gi issues so declined. Because I only needed the scope for the area I was having issues with I had to wait nearly 1 1/2 years. I ended up going elsewhere and had the scope done in a couple of months as is reasonable under the circumstances. I don't think I would see him again. Thank you.","November 28, 2012",3,4,3,3

Dr. Houssein Fergani,"My problem with Dr. Fergani was within 30 seconds after I entered his office he informed me I probably had cancer. This is before any kind of examination or questions. Shouldn't a doctor be somewhat more considerate than to just drop a bomb like that before even looking at you? He then prescribed me with a drug that cost $330 , again, even before examining me. I am on a fixed income with no drug benefits and simply could not afford it. I nearly had a heart attack when I went to the drug store to pick up the pills and they told me the price. At it turned out, after swallowing the camera I did not have cancer and really didn't need the pills. This guy should be more caring about patients feelings.

I was terrified about the procedure but he has more patience than my own mother and spent a huge amount of time with me convincing me that I should not be worried about the test and he even said that if I were his sister with these symptoms, he would make sure that she went for the test. The test truly nothing to worry about. I slept through it and woke up to hear that I had ulcerative colitis. I am on meds for life by I am feeling so much better and thanks to Dr. Fergani's excellent care, I am back to feeling great. His assistant, Diane is a gem and is a huge asset to the office.

By the time I was ready it was again only a minute or two before the Doctor arrived. gave me lots of lovely drugs so I was asleep before the procedure even started and didn't wake up until i was in the recovery room. No pain, the nurses were great - even the intravenus was a breeze. I had a fe polyps removed so undoubtedly will need follow-up and will be pleased to continue with this doctor as his bedside manner was great. Very efficient and effective.","April 28, 2009",5,5,5,5

Dr. Houssein Fergani,"I saw Dr Fergani in May for colo/endo. I work in the medical field and this was on my list of things NEVER to have done. The whole experience made me wonder what my fear was all about. The doctor was knowledgable, kind and relieved my anxiety immediately. His receptionist was lovely and efficient. The staff at ST Jos was experienced, friendly, and informative. I slept through the proceedure and my hubby had to actually tell me that it was all over. I had felt NOTHING. My hubby even wants to go to him next time as his colo was NOT a good experience. My advice, see a doc who will make this a good experience. If you are afraid and don't have this, you may regret the consequences.","September 26, 2008",5,5,5,5
Dr. Houssein Fergani,"Dr.Fergani came to me when I was in emergency, passing out, vomitting blood, he suspected bleeding ulcers and gave me an emergency edoscopy. I was o.k. for a couple of days, then had to be rushed into i.c.u for another endoscopy.Totally I had 7 units of blood, the surgens were standing by ( it would have meant a bi-pass of the bowel) I had 2 kissing deudenal ulcers, I was so weak at the time, and only 60 yrs old. I am so greatful for the excellent work he did on meand his bed side manner was very good. He treated me so well on follow up endoscopies, that I even wanted to give him a hug.I have been clear for 3 years, hopefully I won't need his services again, but I would go back to him if need be. He saved my life without surgery and I am forever thankful.He's amazing with his knowledge and expertise.","February 12, 2008",4,5,5,5
Dr. Houssein Fergani,"I saw Dr. Fergani last year for the first time for what is believed to be IBS. I was supposed to have a colonscopy done but there was an error ( mine) in the booking process, so I never did have it done. I have to admit, I wasn't impressed with him at first so when I referred back to him for another reason, I wasn't thrilled. He immediately noticed that I didn't have the colonoscopy and so now I had to have both the endo and colonscopy. I was so scared and nervous. As it turns out, I didn't need to be. The prep was a breeze ( unlike the previous ones I had done) and the endoscopy too. The colonscopy was alittle painful, but as soon as I voiced discomfort, I was given more medication. Needless to say, my opinion of Dr. Fergani has completely changed and I am now grateful that he was the one I was referred to.","January 18, 2008",5,5,4,5
Dr. Houssein Fergani,"i saw dr. fergani after several months of mysterious stomach/digestive symptoms. not only did he listen to all of my concerns, he took them seriously and saw to it that i was booked for a gastroscopy & colonoscopy ASAP. (there is family history of cancer) he suspected IBS, he wanted to be SURE. i appreciated his willingness to fully investigate my symptoms, instead of just guessing like other doctors have done. i had my scopes done yesterday. i was sedated, but i cried through the entire procedure due to nerves/pain. i had a difficult time calming down even with sedation. unfortunately, that caused the doctor to become rather frustrated with me which was a bit disheartening. however, that is my ONLY complaint. that aside, he is approachable and dealt with my issues in a PROMPT manner, which is more then i can say for A LOT of docs out there. thanks to fergani, i feel like i am FINALLY getting answers.","June 27, 2007","Staff

Dr. Houssein Fergani,"I've seen Dr. Fergani a few times and have nothing but good things to say about him. He listened to what I had to say, and answered all the questions I had. At first he thought I had IBS until I started to mention family history. He was still thinking IBS but agreed to do the colonoscopy because of the famility history and he could tell that I wanted to be sure. The colonoscopy went so well, I thought he didn't do it.","June 4, 2007","Staff

I did't have to wait long in the waiting room which was good but now I know why-he is in too much of a hurry with no bed-side manner. I did't like him.,"February 20, 2007","Staff

I was not properly sedated when given colonoscopy and it was the most painful experience and he seemed not to care. He just seemed to be in a hurry to get it all done. When it was time to look down to my stomach, I had no warning and he just put it in my mouth and I started gagging. He didn't even spray my throat to numb it. A horrible experience. In his office, he is overbooked and does not take the proper time to go over things with you. I would never go to him again or recommend him to anyone.","February 12, 2007","Staff

Dr. Neeraj Narula,"After seeing numerous gastroenterologist over the years, that lacked the ability to listen, believe my symptoms , or even take the time to make one feel comfortable and ask appropriate questions , or even worse seem to be bothered by the fact that I am there with a health problem I have found one who does what all of the other gastroentorolgist have failed to do and that's Dr. Narula. . One of few doctors where you feel like you're his only patient and he's not there to rush you out fast just to bill Ohip , like many other specialists and most of all seems to willing to take on complex cases and challenges , trying to figure out the route cause of a problem. I get the impression he's really there to help and figure out the problem , what physicians are suppose to do , which I feel is very rare in today's medical profession. Only regret is that I didn't get referred to him sooner . Seems very knowledgable on topics other physicians wouldn't even discuss with me , great bed side manner , because he actually listens to the patient , knowledgable without and ego another thing I find rare in today's medical specialists community, couldn't fix my problem because it's a surgical issue but made the appropriate refferall, highly recommend him if you're having stomach issues .","May 9, 2017",5,5,5,5

Dr. Narula is an IBD specialist at McMaster University hospital, he treats patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.

Dr. Norman Emilio Marcon,"Doctor Marcon and his staff are awesome...how anyone could say a negative thing about him and his associates is a joke. Starting with his nurse, Nancy, my encounter with his staff was unbelievable. Nancy called me before going down to St. Michael's to inquire if I would participate in a study that they are doing on Barrett's Oesophagus . She explained the complete procedure and even sent me a video of what would take place. When I arrived at the hospital, she was there to greet me within a couple of minutes of arriving. She explained everything again and helped me through the procedure with compassion and encouragement. When it was my turn for the endoscopy, Dr. Marcon and his associates made me as comfortable as they could. If you've ever had one of these procedures, it isn't pleasant but they did what they could to make it bearable since I was awake for the whole process. The recovery nurse was super also...asking me what she could do to make my recovery more pleasant and comfortable. After leaving the recovery room, we had a sit down with Dr. Marcon and he explained what was going to happen next and what he wanted me to do in the interim. I was a bit groggy still so I failed to ask a couple of questions that I should have when talking to the doctor. Today I sent Dr. Marcon an email with my questions and he phoned me a couple of hours later! Who does that? Certainly no doctor that I know of and I have and have had some excellent doctors. He talked to me for a few minutes explaining everything again and alleviating some of the fears that I had on my drive home (we live 5 hours away from Toronto). This man is a credit to his profession and I am the luckiest guy in the world to have such a terrific and compassionate person looking after me even though I know my ordeal with this disease is far from over.

He has respected my wishes to test altering dosage with current medication, as opposed to switching medication entirely. His offices does appointment times instead of cattle call like most offices, ie very little wait time. Only reason I don't give five stars across the board is due to his staff not sharing in his passion for the patient. They have a strict NO SERVICE during 12-1 lunch hour and can be a tad miserable. Nonetheless, this makes his practice a glowing success story by Ontario standards.","August 31, 2016",3,5,5,5
Dr. S. Farjalla,"I had a very bad experience with this doctor. He was not flexible enough after he found out my colonoscopy rezults showed nothing he expected even though my symptoms were still there. He put me on laxatives and metamucil for close to 10 months and had me visit him every 2 months. Every time i visited and told him my condition didnt change, he always advised me on how often to take the laxatives and metamucil and when exactly during the day. The thing is that, he actually gave contradictory information in different visits. I realized he didnt really know my condition but instead tried to do some trial and error as long as he got paid for my every visit.
In my last visit, he realised he was defeated and actually talked rudely to me when i lamented about the fact that there was no change in my condition. I simply wanted him to see if he could do further diagnosis instead of perpetually putting me on laxatives and metamucil because those over the counter drugs are actually suppose to be taken for a period not more than two weeks. Instead, he dismissed me rudely this time and left the room right away before i could say a word. He told me to go back to my family doctor.
So after 10 months i was not diagnosed with anything even though i have very embarassing symptoms","July 5, 2016",3,1,1,1

Faris put me through thorough testing and attempted treatments that fall outside of the box for Gastroparesis treatments. Unfortunately, these treatments did not work for me, and she has referred me on to another doctor, because other than providing support, there is nothing more she can do for me.

Every time we communicate to book/ reschedule an appointment, she's always eating on the phone while we're talking. Sometimes I have to make her repeat what she said. There are lunch breaks and whatnot.. She rarely returns calls also- God forbid if someone needed to get in right away. Needless to say it's a stressful situation having to get through to the office (since the line is pretty much always busy). I wish there was a more professionalism on her part.

The doctor conducted a thorough interview, answered all my questions and addressed my concerns.

It is my belief that during my first experience back in the early-80's I came very close to losing my life as no one had been able to diagnose my illness. Dr. Wolman was the kindest, well-mannered doctor I had. He explainedd what was occuring as it did and took the time to explain everything to me and my parents. He has the best bedside manners and just a kindness about him that makes you know that you're in good hands. The only section above that I struggle giving him a 5 rating, is being punctual... Although his office tries, I believe their ""tardiness"" is somewhat due to the fact that no patient is ever rushed during thier appointment.

I saw another gastroenterologist because Dr. Reimer, as well as 1/2 the staff, was away sick. I specifically said multiple times I wanted to be asleep for everything and 2 minutes after saying this, the doctor was rude and condescending to me and then inserted the camera without sedating me first.

Only thing is, I watched the procedure in YouTube which made me so nervous.
Dr. ABDALIAN took time to explain the procedure and assured me that it will be a painless procedure and my safety & comfortability will be his top most concern. This has given me much relief. He and his staff made few jokes to ease me and I could swear I was out like a light right after the mouthpiece was placed. Didn't feel a single pain all throughout. Dr. Abdalian's right, the only pain I ""suffered"" was the needle for anaesthesia.
If all Doctors will be like him, patients will never be scared of the procedure.
Lastly, any patient will come home with clearer insights on the diagnosis and maintenance.
North York Hospital is fortunate to have him in their rosters.

The entire procedure was fantastic....seamless, the staff were relaxed, yet professional and caring. They made lots of eye contact and small talk as they prepared. I can't believe how relaxed I was. Dr. Abdalian took the time to sit and talk to me and actually had important notes on my medical history that we discussed. He listened, took his time and in no way was any part of the experience rushed. He was thorough and a pleasure to talk to. Yup, thats right...this doctor is someone you actually want to communicate with. The anesthesiologist was a beautiful Serbian woman who quickly put me at ease. Her IV skills were amazing...barely felt the needle. I went into the procedure calm and woke up the same.

Before being put under anesthesia him and his staff used humour and small talk to get me to relax along with piano music.

As you can see from previous reviews she never answers phone calls, forgets to send referrals to other doctors, never provides you with test dates ahead of time (hospital called me the night before to remind me of test, fasting was required which I almost did not do if they had not called me) and one can never book an appoinment ahead of time. she is always late in answering your calls and is rude! When you call to inquire then she says ""oh I was just about to call you!"" Very sad that such an amazing doctor would align himself with such a cold hearted and unprofessional person. If you do read your reviews Dr. Abdalian, please address your secretary issues for the better of your patients. As a doctor you are 5 stars but your staff is a zero!","June 21, 2015",1,3,5,5

Dr. Rupert Abdalian,"Once you get face-to-face with Dr. Abdalian, he is knowledgeable, respectful and caring. However, he and his receptionist are almost impossible to reach for questions, appointments bookings or prescription refills. 6 months after starting a new biologic medication, I initiated a request for a follow-up appointment . 2 weeks after leaving a phone message, I received, via snail mail from my FP, a copy of an appointment notification with Dr. A one month hence.

Dr. Rupert Abdalian,"Dr. Abdalian is one of the emerging great minds in Toronto gastroenterology. I had the honour of being part of his practice for 2 years (before I relocated). While young, he speaks with the knowledge of someone practicing for decades. He's very familiar with conditions and treatment plans but I'm most impressed with his knowledge of emerging trends and treatments. Clearly a very well-read professional. He has great bedside manner, takes the time to explain complex topics in an understandable way for his patients and shows a genuine level of caring unlike anything I've experienced elsewhere in my medical history. Wait times are minimal (15 minutes to an hour, max) compared to hospital GE clinics (30 minutes to 3 hours... I've been a patient of both). Front desk is very polite, courteous, quickly knows patients on first-name basis and is multi-lingual. By far the best gastroenterology care I've received in my lifetime. Highly recommended to all.","June 9, 2014",5,4,5,5

He even calls home informing if there's any changes in the blood work or any other reports . Surgery is always his last option. The staff are well as great. They were very responsible and punctual when it comes to communicating the messages to the doctor. All messages were responded within 24 hours. We pray for Dr Abdalian every day.

Within the first 6 months Dr Abdalian diagnosed me correctly & I have been on the path to healing. I have had a couple of ""bumps"" in the road recently with my ulcers bleeding again as well as gallbladder issues but he has once again stepped in to make sure that I am receiving the proper care.

Dr. Nadeem Hussain,"Kind of a mediocre experience. The wait time to see him is long but I suppose it's worth it. He is thorough, more so than his resident who was awfully dismissive of my symptoms. He's not personable but he's knowledgeable and that's more important. My only complaint is that there are issues with how the clinic functions. The staff are very good people, but there appears to be some kind of issue with appointments and checking in. The doctor accused me of missing an appointment in the past that I swore up and down had not been the case. I went home to learn that the day in question was the endoscopy which I had attended - but he hadn't! Maybe he was remembering it wrong? I'm not sure if someone made a mistake when checking me in but I had been there and he was holding the test results from that day in his hands. I'm glad he didn't charge me for ""missing"" it but it all seemed so ridiculous. That would be the second time I wasn't fully checked into the system, another time, after registering at the desk, I waited three hours past my appointment only to find out that I was never actually checked in. I did get to see him eventually. This could be a technical error but I hope they fix it so appointments run more smoothly in the future.","April 25, 2017",3,3,5,5

Afterwards, he left the building before I woke up and could talk to him, which apparently astonished the nurses who were in charge of post-procedure patients. When I went for my follow up, I saw a med student who wasn't very confident, and when he went to check if dr hussain would see me, he said he was too busy and would not.

No one likes to have to visit the doctor, but Dr. Hussain is reassuring and makes you feel as if your needs will be met. I never felt rushed during my appointment, despite sharing many stories and episodes with him.

So in the end, his bedside manner is not so great. As for personal experience in his knowledge, the Doctor told me, in not so many words, I was not experiencing a side effect of a prescribed medication and it was me personally experiencing it mentally in a raised tone. The side effect was confirmed by not only online databases but clearly an absent history of this side effect in my life. This in turn led to the Doctor to storm out of the room.

His secretary did not return my calls and finally he did just too tell me he had literally done nothing that he promised to my face. For pain he told me to take ""tylenol."" UNBELIEVABLE. As if I had not thought a year ago to try tylenol. It only tells me he did not take any of it seriously!!!","March 21, 2011",2,4,1,2

Dr. James Culnan,It's 10 years that I have UC but most of the time on remission. My recent bleeding started about 8 months ago and I told Dr Culnan that it should be some kind of infection as all symptoms are very different this time but he refused. He even told me that I couldn't walk to his office if I had infection! and even refused to do a colonoscopy. He put me on different types of medications even steroids but no luck. My pain and bleeding got worse and it effected my life and work but still he refused to even do some kinds of tests to make sure there is no infections! I lost 30 lbs in about 8 months and after I insisted on that he accepted to have a colonoscopy. He told me that he can not do it as he is retired and it should be done by a younger GI. during my colonosctopy the new doctor diagnosed that I have severe colon infection which could be easily treated 8 months ago!

If you ever have him, consider yourself very fortunate.","September 10, 2013",5,5,5,5
Dr. James Culnan,Dr. Culnan has been my GI specialist for over 10 years now. He treats my UC. I absolutely love him and would prefer him over any other GI specialist anyday. He has always been very understanding and caring. He goes out of his way to make sure his patients are ok and comfortable. He returns calls very promptly and takes his time to explain his findings. He involves his patients in his treatment plan. He called the hospital so that when I came into emergency they were already expecting me. It cut my wait time by half and I was given a bed within 4 hours of triage. He is a saint! I really value his opinion and respect him as a doctor and a person.,"November 3, 2012",5,5,5,5
Dr. James Culnan,"Wow.. i cannot believe the positive reviews this doctor seems to be getting. My experience with him was ATROCIOUS. He spent all of 5 mins asking me about my problem (i have a severe LUQ pain after eating/drinking for almost a year now). Told me, and I'm basically quoting here, that since it's been a year and i haven't died yet, then it's nothing to worry about. Said ""I can put you on pills if that's what you want"". Yeah, great doctor. To me he seems like a typical MD who relies too much on big pharma and has overstayed in his profession to a point where he just doesn't care anymore. Please retire Dr. Culnan and lets get some fresh new talented doctors that doesn't follow the medical system of 60s and 70s and actually care to make a difference in people's lives.","Submitted June 13, 2012",5,5,1,1
Dr. James Culnan,In my experience Dr. Culnan is a very special Doctor. He displays an inordinate level of compassion. He exemplifies someone who goes into the practice of medicine to help people and has maintained his dedication. Once I witnessed him decide to drive a patient home after a colonoscopy because he didn't want the patient to attempt to walk home. He provides a rationale for his recommendations and involves the patient in decision making. I wish he could be cloned.,"May 19, 2012",5,5,5,5
Dr. James Culnan,"Bar none Dr. James Culnan has to be by far the best Gastroenterogolist dr. I have ever had the luck and blessing to cross paths with.It was Dr. Culnan who finally had a diagnosis for my Ulcerative Colitis after 22 years of not knowing what was wrong with me.He is a both right to the point kind of physician but also compassionate and caring.It was Dr. Culnan who during his morning consults with me after having my colon removed due to my Ulcerative Colitis actually tell me to scoot over so he could lie next to me and go over my daily readings,such as blood and potassium levels.Every year I have the pleasure to see him so that I could get my sigmoid scope done to make sure my j-pough(ileoanastomosis), is functioning the way it should.I would literally shout his praises on a roof top he is that awsome.I look at him as a father figure in a way,you could honestly get the feeling that this man really cares about each and everyone of his patients.I feel exceptionally blessed to be one of those patients.","April 25, 2012",5,5,5,5

I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking a GI specialist.","March 24, 2015",5,5,5,5
Dr. Sam Elfassy,"Dr. Elfassy is by far the best doctor I have ever dealt with. I see that some people have rated him low for punctuality, but I would have to make a point to defend him about this. He is extremely hard working, and takes care of quite a few seriously ill patients, myself included. When you do go to see him, take note of how full his waiting room is. He starts work at 7am, and would often come visit me in the hospital as late as 7pm. I must take responsibility for a few occasions where I took up other patients time in life threatening emergency situations. Anytime I called about an emergency, he made immediate time for me, and therefore, I took up some of his other patients time. This however, in my opinion, only shows what a caring doctor he is.... If you are seriously sick, he cares enough to make time for you. Although I do apologize for taking up other people's time in emergencies, I can assure you that they were genuine life threatening emergencies in which Dr. Elfassy literally saved my life. 
He is a persistent young man that exhausts all his resources without ever giving up. There were two occasions where I wanted to give up, but he was relentless in his support and hope.
He oversaw my care while I was hospitalized for a month, and was by my bedside almost every single day.
Yes, he is quite young. However, this is an attribute rather than a flaw. Because of his youth, he is knowledgeable about new research, technologies, medication, procedures, and rare diseases. He utilizes technology to find a diagnoses, and has the best bedside manners I have ever encountered. He is also less likely to retire anytime soon, which makes me feel better knowing that I will have him as support for a long time.
He was the first doctor to ever believe me, after suffering with abdominal adhesions for three years; and having doctors from other hospitals telling me it was in my head. He diagnosed me with gastroparesis, and a suspicion of abdominal adhesions from a previous surgery. I would not be alive today if it were not for Dr. Elfassy, as when the surgeon found my adhesion, it was the size of a car seatbelt, and had begun to strangle my intestines.
This doctor goes above and beyond, and in the course of being so ill, I have dealt with dozens of doctors and specialists. There is no other doctor that I would give a higher rating to. He is second to none.","January 10, 2015",5,5,5,5

Dr. Jamie Gregor,"Dr. Gregor is quite possibly the worst doctor I've ever seen. My experience of him has been completely contrary to the other reviews here. He always keeps me waiting (sometimes up to an hour in clinic), seems unconcerned about side effects of heavy drugs such as methotrexate, and how they may affect the future of a 20 year old woman. I have had a difficult case where I have had serious adverse reactions to many medications and treatments, and he has used this to try to guilt me into consenting to treatments I am not comfortable with. He has never listed side effects, pros or cons of any medications, handed me any pamphlets or given me any additional alternative treatments. He has't even been able to offer me a referral to a dietitian. He seems far more concerned with how much money he is going to make off the drugs he prescribes you than how they work for you. This man should be in a research lab working on medications and treatments, not dealing with people.","October 31, 2011",2,1,1,2

He answers all my questions and has never dismissed any of my concerns. He always asks if there's ""anything else"" before he leaves the room, and/or hovers by the door for a few seconds just in case. Dr. Gregor readily orders all sorts of tests instead of just guessing what the problem is. He lists several alternatives for treatment and describes pros and cons of each, so that I can choose what is best for me. When proposing serious treatment options (i.e. strong drugs), he provides brochures; he readily sends in staff to discuss financial aid options for expensive drugs. To sum up: he's awesome. I highly recommend him to anyone with gastrointestinal problems.","July 13, 2009",4,4,5,5

I was doubled over in pain, bleeding, and this was dismissed as normal when one has a few polyps zapped. A year later I still have pain in the exact same area!
2nd experience of the same doctor was at Brampton Civic Hospital for upper GI endoscopy. Dr breezed in with Tim Horton's in hand and shiny penny loafers. Exam room suddenly filled with several students to watch my procedure. None of this was cleared with me. Never saw the Doctor gown or wash his hands before I was knocked out for the test.

Dr. Maya Doumit,Staff did not return phone calls. Nurse prior to colonoscopy was great and was kind and calming. Dr Doumit is set in her way and not willing to work with you or consider other problems which may be underlaying. Only wants to treat symptoms but not willing to search deeper to solve the root of what seems to be a complex problem (in my case). The amount of faith a person puts into a specialist and the amount of time it takes to see one and to be dismissed so casually is very discouraging.,"August 12, 2012",3,3,1,1

My pharmacist did that on August 2. NO response. Dr. Thien is now back on the 15th. It's now August 18th, still NO response. Left 2 messages, NO response as to why script is not renewed. Pharmacist faxes script renewal again on August 17th. NO response. Pathetic!! How the heck do you leave a voice message saying the doc is on vacay AND to fax in scripts as per usual with NO back-up doc to sign off??? So patients are to be without medication for 2+ weeks?? Finally had to book an appt with GP to get script filled. Obviously this doc doesnt care about patients. There has to be some notification system in place so patients know when to fax scripts in when the doc is gone.. OR have a back up doc to sign off on renewals. Just an absolute mess... I can imagine a pile of 20-30 script renewals on his desk unsigned by patients that need their meds. 4-letter words is appropriate here but I know it would be held for censorship. *frustrated & annoyed*","Submitted August 18, 2016",1,1,1,1

He never remembered my health history or what he prescribed or did for me previously. Also, he can be quite rude. On top of that, his secretary (at the Davisville office) will drive you crazy with her pedantic and even more rude attitude.

Dr. John Kenneth Marshall,"I had Dr. Marshall for several yrs and found him to be pleasant and capable. I did not feel that appt wait times of 8 months for a consultation and then another 6 months for a colonoscopy was at all responsible nor acceptable. He's not that good!! Pts of his would laugh in the waiting room about how many letters they had received over the yrs. a couple months before your appt that ""due to unforseen reasons your appt has been changed to...."" You already waited over a half yr to see him and now it's cancelled and wait long. Don't try and phone his secretary, she's one miserable person who is a secretary, but thinks she is a doctor. If YOU need to cancel an appt however, she almost punishes you (that's how she makes you feel), but I said that I had to cancel as my mother died. I had already told her that as I would be attending her funeral. She therefore gave me an appt for 6 more months down the road. I called the clinic staff and asked them to put me on a cancellation list. She was to much to handle and although he was fine, he wasn't ""all that"" for appts to be so long of a wait list. He said he was getting more into research therefore he would not be seeing as many pts. When I told other doctors that, they looked surprised and said they never heard anything about that, colorectal surgeons, at that. I would strongly advise anyone who needs a GI. doctor, go to the RUDD Clinic. It's in Oakville, but just past Burlington (not in the heart of Oakville). You will get an appt within a week or so and if you require a colonoscopy it will be booked with 2 weeks. In a month , you will have a GI consult, Colonoscopy and your f/u appt. All they do is GI and they have wonderful GI doctors, nurses and clerical staff. They have several Clinics that are GI only. If you are in Hamilton or area, they are only 20 minutes on the highway and a block off. Easy, fast directions and FREE parking. Don't wait around Hamilton trying to get an appt with a GI doctor as you will wait months, if it doesn't get cancelled and then you wait longer, than longer again for a procedure. The RUDD Clinic is so close if you are at Mac anyways, it's only 20 minutes further and you will be seen within a week or 2 and procedures are done as well as swiftly. GI in Hamilton is horrible!!!!","August 28, 2017",1,2,2,2

Dr. John Kenneth Marshall,"I saw Dr Marshal twice at the behest of another gi doc. I saw Dr marshal at juravinski both times. I would have to rate the man and the residents under him at an extremely low score , with a high risk score in care , and attention to detail. Dr marshal left me unattended in the ER for 9 hours the first day and 6 hours the second day. This lack of care put me into severe dehydration, incredible pain and great risk to my many other health problems flaring. I spent 2 days in the ER under Dr Marshal care ( as the primary ) with no fluids . In the 2 days I had 300 ml of IV fluid. I was put as NPO so I waited at the mercy of the very young and careless ER staff for simple hydration. None came until day 3 !
With dehydration so severe my liver enzymes began to rise , my c02 level was high .. my potassium was high .. my sodium was very low .
I explained over and over to Dr Marshal "" team "" that I had liver problems and one kidney that didn't work well and that I was very dry and flat . The minute I used medical terminology ( that has come from years of experience with personal illness ) I was then shunned by these doctors. My colon was very tender with extreme distention. And pain on quick touch release . Dr marshal and his team of residents at juravinski were talking in the hall outside my room .. I heard them say "" send her to another hospital that she chooses "" "" I don't want to deal with her "" then one of them clapped his hands and said ready ..Let's get her out of here. 
This is when they entered the room . They explained that even tho my gi from another hospital said stay don't leave , that he had only said that because he was on the phone and without being physically present , telling me to stay absolved him of any liability . CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS ??? They further went on to say that the CT I had was most likely false findings . Hmm a false CT anyone ever heard of that before ? I haven't. They were told at this point that I heard every word they said in the hall , and the response I got was "" we were talking about a 96 year old patient and she had trouble drinking the peg lyte and possibly you might also "" I explained that this was not true and that they didn't want me to stay as it would force them to accept the gross failure of care . I then stood up and lost control of my bowel . Seeing that I had lost control of my bowel. .. they disregarded that and said go home ! 
I had to call my gi multiple times over the 4 day stay to get advice from a professional Doctor on what I should do. I was again advised to stay. 
I had to beg for blood work to be taken as my body began swelling in areas other than my abdomen. I explained that my liver was a big concern and that my kidney function was also a big concern . Why would a patient have to beg for blood tests ?? It wasn't until discharge that I got the results of my blood ... my c02 was high .. my potassium my alt ast had risen every day since Arrival my sodium was low my CRP was high ....I was told by Dr Phine to disregard the blood work numbers, they were unconcerned about them. 
I was given the colonoscopy I stayed for, and told Dr marshal that fentynal did not work for me and I would not anesthetize Dr marshal scoffed with his usual arrogant bedside manner and gave me fentynal. .. I did not sleep through the procedure of colonoscopy and biopsy. .. I instead cried out in pain , just as I said I would. 
If I can take this experience and share it with one person only, that will listen and find a competent Doctor instead - I will list it everywhere! 
I do not recommend Dr Marshal nor do I recommend his residents at juravinski . Dr Patelra or Dr Phine . In my opinion this whole experience has confirmed again that Dr Marshal is in my opinion incompetent, arrogant and ignorant and unethical ! His residents covered his incompetence and their own with lies. 
I will be filing a complaint at the college of physicians and surgeons.","July 18, 2016",1,1,1,2
Dr. John Kenneth Marshall,"I have been seeing Dr Marshall for several years now. The only complaint I have...there needs to be two of him, maybe three. Appointments months away but understand that means my problem can wait and I do have a GP and yes I can go to the ER if required. He is an awesome Doctor. Knowledgable, patient and an excellent doing procedures. People need to realize they are not his only patient and he doesn't have ESP. Communication is vital and tests don't show everything. He has to be an investigator...health has many layers of grey, rarely black and white. Josie...always helpful and understanding. Treat people with respect and they'll treat you the same.","July 1, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. John Kenneth Marshall,Ive been seeing him for yrs now. The first three he was amazing and so understanding.he listened to what was going on and helped u. Now that hes gotten into research u cant get an appointment for months so u end up in hospital in so much pain.i told him for a yr something was wrong to be told it crohns enjoy being skinny and ill give u psin meds. Because of that i almost died and had life saving surgery that he didn't know about. He lies about test results if there bad because he doesn't know how to help u. He doesn't like patients that look up medication or say no to a drug. If u get a second opinion u then get attitude by him and his staff. Honestly lost all trust as ive almost died twice now. Im still very ill with no help and told to have surgery i dont need to make things easier on him not me,"September 15, 2015",2,1,2,2

Dr. John Kenneth Marshall,Excellent bed-side manner and VERY knowledgeable in his field. A pleasure to deal with!,"April 19, 2015",5,4,5,5
Dr. John Kenneth Marshall,"I have been seeing Dr. Marshall for several yrs. He is difficult to get an appt. even when your GP is requesting it more urgently. His secretary is often quite rude and non-accommodating. Her answer for everything is just to go to the ER. She is quite blunt in telling you that she cannot get you in for an appt.In other words, you have to wait the 5o6 mos. even though you're symptomatic. Obviously, you end up in hospital. Dr. Marshall is a very good doc and very knowledgeable. He doesn't rush the appt. and listens and also tries to answer any questions. He is quite pleasant and makes you feel comfortable when examining you or doing any procedures. I wish my diagnosis was more definitive as it seemed to be when I lived in another city. I was dx with UC in Toronto and it is well documented. I gave him the notes, but he is not sure what the dx. is, but treats it like UC. I would highly recommend him.The other staff are good. It's just Josie who needs an inservice in people relations.","October 27, 2013",3,3,5,5
Dr. John Kenneth Marshall,"This is the first time I've ever been compelled to rate a doctor....and it's because I'm so pleased. I've always been terrified of a colonoscopy after having a horrific experience with a barium enema when I was young. I put off having a colonoscopy even though I was having some abdominal aches and constipation problems. Finally I realized I would have to go through it, and my doctor said people had told her Dr. Marshall was very good. Was he ever! I was afraid I would feel cramps during the procedure....I felt nothing painful or harsh whatsoever. Doing a ""good"" colonoscopy is a skill, and not all gastro doctors are as skilled at it....I am telling my husband to go to him when his next colonoscopy is due. Dr. Marshall is the best!!! He is the colonoscopy king!! I'll never be afraid of this procedure again because of him.....Also McMaster has a new endoscopy unit which is very nice....that helps too...","October 18, 2013",5,4,5,5

Dr. Jeffrey Baker,I was under Dr Baker's care for a few years until I left Canada for the Caribbean. He was exceptionally compassionate and thoughtful. After my diagnosis he gave me the literature on dif meds and we had a thorough discussion on my treatment plan. I was actually part of the equation which is rare in medicine. I very fondly look back at my years under his care from emerg at another hospital/another GI to him taking over my care and doing it properly. Can't say enough positive things about my experience with him.,"March 12, 2017",4,4,5,5
Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"Perhaps there are ""two"" Dr. Jeffrey Bakers. The one who is compassionate and helpful and the other one who is flippant and dismissive. Sadly, I met with the second one. I consulted him with symptoms of rectal bleeding and reflux. He was completely unconcerned about my rectal bleeding, preferring instead to complain about the Ontario health care system. To address my GERD symptoms, he came up to me where I sat, felt my belly and told me to lose weight. (I'm 5'6"" 150lb) I was left with the impression that my consultation was a waste of his time. I felt it was a waste of my time, too.","January 26, 2017",5,3,2,3
Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"Great experience with Dr. Baker. He has a rare and fantastic bedside manner -- very calm and reassuring. Almost a pity he's not an oncologist, because if you were ever to get a horrible diagnosis, he's the guy you'd want to hear it from.","January 11, 2017",4,4,5,5
Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"I have had two consultations with Dr. Baker and so far, I'm very disappointed. He may be knowledgeable but I find him cavalier and he didn't seem at all interested in hearing about my symptoms.

Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"Thorough, polite, professional, compassionate, detail the whole experience. The process, from my perspective, was run with the caring and attention of a top notch spa by Dr. Baker and his entire staff. I met with Dr. Baker before and after the procedure to discuss what to expect, the process and post-procedure to review the results. He was informative and patient. Over the years, this was my third procedure under Dr. Baker's care and each one has been worthy of 6 stars.","February 6, 2015",5,5,5,5

Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"I've read the comment posted on 4/27/13 by someone who I am wondering if they ever met Dr. Jeff Baker of St Michaels Hospital, Toronto. He is one of the most brilliant doctors who is conscientious, caring, and dedicated. So are his team of professionals at St Mikes. He saved both my father's and my husband's lives - with the right decisions that in both cases took a lot of understanding and patience to explain to the patients that their only options, while shocking in both cases, were the only ones to save them. The ongoing care was exemplary. What more can anyone ask for? Not only can any patient trust that they are in the right hands - they'll be very lucky if he takes them on as a patient (because he has a huge roster of patients).","August 22, 2013",5,5,5,5
Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"Dr Baker wasn't interested to help at all. He even didn't bother to hear my symptoms and problems. Gastroscopy was done mostly by his student while he was present. They missed to do stomach biopsy. They did only duodenal biopsy. 12 days after procedure I started to feel sensation in duodenal area with occasion sharp pain. Went to see Dr Baker, he didn't care at all. 3 months after procedure I started to feel more pain. I think they damaged something. Don't waste your time and body.

I liked that I never felt like I was wasting his time - even when I was overly anxious and asked the same questions numerous times.

Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"It takes me sometimes 45mins--1hr to get to Dr Baker's office so he has been helful with accomodating my appointment times. When I first saw him he gave me plenty of information, pamphlets, websites, etc to help me better understand what my body was going through. Not all doctors take that seriously & I beleive he is a better doctor for doing that instead of just writing a prescription & sending you on your way. I had seen two other doctors before him who didn't help anywhere near as much as he has & I won't go anywhere else. He also makes sure all examinations are accomponied by a nurse so you feel at ease.","January 16, 2009",5,5,5,5
Dr. Jeffrey Baker,"Well, what can I say. The first time I met Dr. Baker he felt it was best to give me a colonoscopy on the spot! Not literally on the spot, but there in the hospital without advance warning. Nothing too deep, been there done that. Besides, I've got a sense of humour. He's great, and I wish I could have taken him along when I moved from Toronto. He's easy to speak to, confident in his work and amicable. Cheers.","August 1, 2008",5,4,5,5

I have never dealt with someone as unprofessional as he in my life. I have a long history of health issues and I have been a patient of many doctors and assistants, and I have never seen such incompetence. He didn't return my calls for an urgent appointment so I had to go to his office in person to speak in person. He made an inappropriate comment about my clothes, asking me why I ""chose to wear that shirt"". I strongly encourage future patients to re-think their choice in seeing a GI. Nguyen is a good doctor, but it's not worth seeing him and having to deal with his assistant, Harry. I can't stress this enough. I have spoken with other patients, and they feel the same way.","June 27, 2014",1,1,2,3
Dr. Robert Fingerote,Dr. Fingerote is very knowledgeable and seemed to know every corner of his practice. I was happy with my overall visit specially with his friendly secretary. I don't understand why she was given bad reviews in the past but it was not the case with me.,"September 24, 2017",5,4,5,5
Dr. Robert Fingerote,"The area of his practice is so depending on the history of the illness that most of the time, the diagnosis would be made by history taking only. I was amazed when Dr Fingerote made a text book typical diagnosis at the end of the our first session. Special kind of MRI, confirmed his diagnosis. One of the good old-school doctors who listened to me, and did not underestimated the value of the history and physical examination. The MRI and lab results were just confirming his findings. I trusted him with my life.","September 11, 2017",3,5,5,5
Dr. Robert Fingerote,"Dr. Fingerote is a great doctor and a great man. He treated me, not just my guts. Some of the scans and tests can be scary but DrFingerote take time to explain everything in a way you can understand. I have rated him 4 for punctuality but the wait is not due to over booking, the fact is he takes time with his patients.","August 25, 2017",5,4,5,5
Dr. Robert Fingerote,"Dr Fingerote's arrogance is only exceeded by his unprofessionalism. He was more concerned with hitting on our family member than providing her with medical care. On more than one occasion he told her she was beautiful and said she was 'his most attractive patient' and gave her his personal BBM contact information. When our family decided to take her off her TPN (with the support of her palliative doctor) Fingerote arrived at her hospital room (when he was no longer her doctor or formally informed of our choice) and berated her family and told her 21 year old daughter 'you're killing your mother'. Followed by having a breakdown and storming out of the room. He then BBM'd the patient telling her not to come off the TPN, when she was incoherent and no longer the executor of her medical care. In this message he said he could keep her alive for 1-2 years (she had stage 4 cancer spreading through her body and her Princess Margaret oncologists said she only had a few months). As a result of Dr. Fingerote's inappropriate communication and her impaired cognition (due to her cancer), she was made to feel confused and given false hope. It is clear that his feelings for our family member impacted his professional judgement and caused her and our family immense stress and unnecessary pain during this already tortuous time.","July 29, 2017",1,1,1,1
Dr. Robert Fingerote,"Dr. Fingerote has a terrible secretary who can't communicate in english properly, does not arrange appointments for the patients in a timely manner.

In my first appointment the doctor asked me if I was sexually actively, I said yes, I'm 32, thought I am ""single"" I am, his response, though I can't remember it verbatim was inappropriate and he knew it because right after he said it he told me to ""forget what he said, he shouldn't of said that. ""
My second appointment he was late, I went to line up for the washroom and when I was the next in line the receptionist called me, I told her I was just going to use the washroom, 2 minutes later I went up to reception and she said I had to wait since the doctor, who had me wait, couldn't wait two minutes for me to pee, had taken the next patient! More waiting! I'm not impressed!","March 7, 2017",2,3,2,2
Dr. Robert Fingerote,"I find a lot of comments against Dr. Fingerote's secretary funny. Did she schedule your scopes and lab work did she remind you to come to your appointment? I think these are the important issues that everybody seems to forget. She is a secretary! She is here to do a job not to be your friend. When I came to Dr. FIngerote's office I was in pain every day and I could not sleep. He helped me like no other Dr. ever has. His secretary made sure I received an urgent follow-up appointment and made sure that my scope was booked quickly. You think that his secretary was not nice to you?

After a while he is more than tolerable and is able to understand your problems and explain them to you extremely well. Only problem is his receptionist; she doesn't speak english and gets frustrated with it which translates into an attitude problem. One of the better doctors out there; probably a long wait time unless it's an emergency but what else do you expect for a specialist?,"March 10, 2016",3,5,5,5
Dr. Robert Fingerote,"The doctor himself was great friendly and helpful but the receptionist is extremely rude and really should not be doing what she does, I can't even understand how she got the position in the first place. Being a person who works on the phone all day speaking with people confirming information taking inquiries I do know a phone etiquette and she clearly has none. She actually hung up on me after rudely telling me about an appointment that i had without even stating who she was calling for ,as it turned out while she was rumbling on without letting me speak and talking over me when I tried to ask her a question she was calling the wrong patient. I advised her of the mistake and suggested she checks her information prior to calling or at least state clearly who she is calling for but I guess the ignorant and immature can't take a suggestion well. She ended up hanging up. It's too bad cause I have questions that I would like to ask over the phone but I tend to write them down and ask when I see the doctor. I recommend the doctor but the receptionist. .. um ya train her or ..","February 12, 2016",1,1,4,4

He sees me every 6 months does regular ultrasounds lab work and encourages me with my diet and helps me stay off the alcohol. I am empathetic to the woman who lost her father to liver disease. Did he not stop drinking? Did he not follow up with appointments and ultrasounds? Did he take his medication as required? I understand her grief but it is wrong to take her anger out at such an outstanding physician. Perhaps she should see a psychiatrist instead of venting in a public forum such as Ratemds.,"October 21, 2014",5,5,5,5

His appts were scheduled months apart and even after being hospitalized, this dr could of cared less to see him once discharged. I researched my fathers illness thoroughly and asked questions only to be ignored. I called the office to ask questions and the ill-mannered disrespectful non-English speaking receptionist was painful to speak to and would not let my questions be asked!!! I was 7 months pregnant and dealing with BS!!! This Dr told me following his advice my father would be around for years, and 2 months later was hospitalized and passed 1 month later!! I was 8 months pregnant and knowing that my father, my everything passed due to an arrogant physician and never met my son makes me physically ill daily. Knowing my mother is a widow at 65!! He took my dad's prime years away from him. Run from this garbage, don't ever step foot near this office. After speaking to others who have gone to him, they all have the same experience.

Patients must learn, that after telling your doctor your symptoms , etc, that you must LISTEN!! , instead of wanting to continue to hear your own voice! In Dr. Fingerote's case, this is like listening to pearls of wisdom.

He has a no nonsense attitude regarding treatment and his honesty is probably the best thing his patient could ever hear because it is a sincere wake up call and reminder that life is too precious to take for granted.

Dr. Shane Hadlock,"Dr. headlock saved my life when diagnosing a very rare tumour in my small intestine during a routine colonoscopy. Less than 1 percent of the population will be diagnosed with a Carcenoid tumour and that was what Dr. Hadlock found in April 2014. He knowledge and quest to go the extra mile so the speak propelled him to scope my colon those extra 2 inches into the ileum wherein not many Gastro do so would be so thorough. It was in this last 2 inches of the procedure he noticed a white patch of skin amid extremely healthy pink tissue. He scoped it and sent it away for pathology...sure enough it was a Carcenoid Tumour but small and encapsulated. I shudder to think about what would have happened if he had not been so ""picky"" and those are the words he used to describe himself. Well I am cancer free today as a result of Dr. Hadlock's expertise and thoroughness! It was caught very early, removed by a great surgeon! Cheryl Turpin","July 6, 2014",5,5,5,5

"Dr. L.A. Lietaer, Retired","Dr. Lietaer has attended upon this humble writer for several years following his thorough examinations and subsequent diagnosis of Crohn's Disease in this host. Dr. Lietaer presents a consistent and professional demeanor at all times, with a glowing and infectious cheer that opens all the doors welcoming you in to his office and at odd times with his arm around your shoulder as if at the reuniting of two old friends. Nothing puts me more at ease than to know that the pain and disease that is now and forever part of my life is being treated with the utmost of his abilities and care as if that pain where his own. Finally, in my own teaching and in my own learning, I have found that any unadulturated expression of gratitude transends this veil of tears and arrives softly to God's own ear.

He treated me very poorly, very dismissively; In writing this comment, I've alright put more thought into him than he did on me.

I'm recommending him to anyone I talk to and really push the simplicity of my experience with this procedure.","February 13, 2015",5,4,5,5
Dr. Subash Jalali,"My experience with Dr Jalali started out well. However, in the last few months, something has changed. He seems to have too many people stacked up for appointments and then is too rushed to spend much time. I sat for nearly 1.5 hours past my scheduled appointment time this last appointment. He had to rifle through papers and review the file to figure out who the heck I was and why I was there. Then he talked over me whenever I was trying to explain something or ask a question. When someone is talking, they have stopped listening. Since he's not always listening, he can make erroneous assumptions. I drive an hour to see him because I believed he had good knowledge. If I'm going to be disrespected by a specialist, I'm sure I could find one closer to home.","October 22, 2014",5,1,3,3
Dr. Subash Jalali,"Dr. Jalali may be a skilled technician, but his knowledge ends with the sedative that he gives. --Versed. It is contraindicated for patients with a history of depression and he was advised of this pre-existing condition when he took the pre-op history. I suffered a paradoxical reaction and have been unable to work for 6 years. My psychiatrist is well aware of the problems with benzodiazepines. Dr. Jalali had never heard of this type of reaction and was dismissive, saying ""I give this all the time without any problems."" It's right there on Wikipedia. I got in a fight with the nurse and swore at her as I came out of sedation. I tried to leave with only a sheet wrapped around me. Furthermore, I was not discharged to a responsible adult and I tried to walk home 25 km (without a wallet or ID). Fortunately, my wife had been called to come for me and she saw me walking along the street. I am covered by disability insurance, otherwise St. Joe's would be in the middle of a major lawsuit. Where did he get his MD?","August 24, 2014",1,1,1,1
Dr. Subash Jalali,"Dr.Jalali is a WONDERFUL specialist. He is knowledgeable, thorough, caring and gives undivided attention to his patients. I had an emergency and he saw me immediately and within one week I had a colonoscopy, a biopsy, a diagnosis and a prescribed treatment plan. His follow up was equally amazing as he made himself available for phone contact. Consider yourself fortunate if you are a patient of Dr.Jalali. If you wait a few extra minutes, it is because he is giving careful attention to the patient who is ahead of you- and he will do the same for you! You cannot go wrong with Dr. Jalali!","December 20, 2013",5,5,5,5

Dr. Subash Jalali,"Wait times to see him are really terrible. Supposed to see him 2 to 3 weeks after procedure. First available was 2 months. when trying to cancell to rebook appointment, Took 3 days before I could get through. Doesn't seem to care a whit about his patients.","May 3, 2010",2,3,2,4
Dr. Subash Jalali,"I have been a patient of Dr. Jalali for many years now and continue to have the greatest respect for him. He is very thorough. I credit my new found state of health to him. He may not be the most talkative gentlemen but he listens carefully to everything you have to say and follows up on it. Dr. Jalali is a brilliant man within his field and I do believe that he feels a duty towards each of his patients to provide the best care possible.

Dr. Subash Jalali,"After having seen Dr. Seaton and being treated terribly, Dr. Jalali was a real pleasure to see.

Dr. Subash Jalali,One of the best in his profession. A little wait is worth it - would you like your appointment cut short so that he sees the next patient in time? Of course not - some patients think that a specialist appointment should always run for 30 or 60 minutes and not 75 - that would be an immature assessment (one example on this ratings site is there - bet that person has not found a better specialist?),"November 25, 2009",5,4,5,5

Dr. Subash Jalali,"the most compassionate and helpful doctor i have ever encountered. he puts in 100% of his effort into each case, as i have both experienced first hand, and heard from others whom i had recommended. the waiting time is unfortunate, but this is only because of his high demand, and it is well worth the wait.","September 25, 2009",5,4,5,5
Dr. Subash Jalali,"This doctor (unlike many others) spends a significant time with patient, listen him good, pays attention to everything and dig into problems. He investigates complicated cases.

Dr. Frederick Bray,Dr. Bray and his staff were all very friendly and all took the time to answer any questions. Dr Bray was especially helpful in taking time before the procedure to explain what he was about to do and why it is important. This is the first time I have rated a Doctor and do so enthusiastically.,"August 16, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Frederick Bray,"I would not recommend this place to anyone going in for a colonoscopy. I brought my healthy 50-year-old mother here for a standard procedure and due to lack of care, she ended up in an ambulance on the drive home and at the General Hospital for the rest of the day. 
 The staff were all friendly and she told me Dr. Bray was very nice as well, but the clinic was 2 hours behind schedule and in turn they rushed her out following the colonoscopy without any monitoring. From what I've heard, all other colonoscopy offices have patients lay down after the procedure, give them some water and a snack, and make sure they are go to the bathroom to relieve gas before leaving the office. They did none of that at this clinic. When I was driving her home, she started to have a lot of pain in her abdomen and I had to pull over, where she consequently went unconscious and was sick all over herself. I had to call her an ambulance and she was taken in to emergency.
 When I called Dr. Bray's office during the whole thing, none of the staff answered the phone until my fourth attempt and then did not even offer to put the doctor on the line for me. If he cared for his patients' well-being, he would have wanted to know himself what went wrong and how he could help. The next day, the RECEPTIONIST called my mother to ask how she was doing - Dr. Bray not once took a few minutes out of his day to check up on his own patient who was in ambulatory care after his work.
 It is great to have good bed-side manners, but patient care goes well beyond charm. My mother was not properly taken care of under Dr. Bray's supervision and he didn't even check up on her following the scary aftermath. To anyone looking for a colonoscopy doctor, I highly recommend going somewhere else with less patients to ensure proper focus be given to your care.","July 19, 2017",1,1,1,1
Dr. Frederick Bray,"Extremely narcissistic, and refuses to even acknowledge the thought of getting a second opinion from another GI dr. even though he has been unsuccessful in helping me with any of my health issues. He has taken on far too many patients which is evident from his 2 hour wait times before appointments, and that's assuming that you even get an appointment booked before next year. If your family doctor needs to refer you to a GI specialist i would ask to not be referred to his clinic. Don't let him fool you, he seems extremely charismatic on first impression, but he has a lot to work to improve in his practice.","May 29, 2017",1,1,1,1
Dr. Frederick Bray,"Dr. Bray and his staff are very kind, well trained and professional. Prior to the procedure Dr. Bray took the time to explain the process in detail as well as the benefits of screening for polyps at an early stage. Following that he gave me time to ask if I had any questions or concerns. I was then lightly sedated and the procedure was over in a half an hour with virtually no discomfort. (Just a little gas afterwards which is normal). I recommend Dr. Bray and his staff very highly -- they are wonderful.","April 11, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Frederick Bray,"I had my first colonoscopy conducted by Dr. Bray at his Woodroffe office this week. I received a call a month in advance to reconfirm the appointment, which was extremely fortunate, as I had recorded the date incorrectly. I arrived 10 minutes prior to my scheduled appointment, and was greeted courteously by the receptionist. I was called into the procedure area promptly at the scheduled hour. Dr. Bray's attending nurse was friendly, knowledgeable and provided me with a very helpful and reassuring explanation of how the appointment would proceed and answered all of my preliminary questions. Dr. Bray gave me a detailed explanation of the procedure, and the importance of colon cancer screening. He invited questions and responded in a full, frank and professional way. The procedure was conducted and I was out of the office in exactly the timeframe anticipated. I was nervous and self-conscious about the procedure. I had no reason to be. Dr. Bray and his staff were outstanding and made a very intimate procedure, much easier to handle than I had anticipated. I'm grateful for the referral to Dr. Bray by my excellent family doctor, Dr. Lisa Moore. Thank you!","January 14, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Frederick Bray,"An anxious experience made comfortable by the knowledgeable and friendly staff. I particularly liked the fact that Dr Bray took the time to illustrate and explain the procedure in detail, as well as to answer any questions I had. I would definitely recommend Dr Bray and his staff.","December 13, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Frederick Bray,recently had a colonoscopy and gastroscopy with Dr. Bray. I was extremely anxious about the procedures and it seemed he and his staff picked on this immediately. The procedures were done with ease . I was made very comfortable and the procedures painless. Dr. Bray and his staff were compassionate and professional. I would recommend Dr. Bray to anyone,"December 1, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Frederick Bray,"My 17 year old daughter was diagnosed with crohns by Dr. Bray. He started her on Pentasa immediately. I watched her suffer for a year. Every time we returned to him for help, his answer was to double the dose and come back in 6 months. I watched my daughter suffer, lose weight and not be able to leave the house. Next visit, double the double dose and come back in 6 months. She got worse every day, it was like watching your child die a slow death. We looked for a new gastroenterologist but none would take her because she was a patient of the great doctor Bray. We finally found Doctor Bolano at the QCH and she did another colonoscopy, she was shocked at the incredibly horrifying state my daughter was in. She immediately started my daughter on Humara. Within a few weeks she was almost back to normal. Not long after, it was determined she was in remission. If there was a way to bring this so called doctor up on charges I would. To this day, he has yet to make contact with us but he has more patients then he needs anyhow as evidenced by the 1 hour wait times in his waiting room. I am still considering writing to the college of physicians.","November 2, 2016",2,1,1,2

Dr. Frederick Bray,"First time having a colonoscopy today and I must admit I was nervous - not sure what to expect. I recommend Dr. Bray in a heartbeat; from his warm bedside manner; to his explanation of the procedure in layman terms; to his experience and knowledge! We need more doctors like him today who actually ""connect"" with their patient. I have never rated a doctor before but Dr. Bray and his staff merit one.","April 11, 2016",5,5,5,5

Dr. Stephen Sinclair,"Dr. Sinclair has no problem doing his job, if his job is only sticking a tube down your throat, up your ass, and analyzing the results. Perfect scores there. Nor does he have a problem being quirky or having a sense of humour. The problem comes when a human patient enters the scene- a patient who is suffering greatly. I was in the hospital for 8 days a month ago because my stomach issues were so severe. Nothing at all showed up in the endoscopy or the colonoscopy. Ok. Not his fault. Dr. Sinclair, however, didn't even bother talking to me after the procedures - he had a psychiatrist see me (who said there was nothing causing the stomach pain in my mind!) and prescribed Dicetel (a drug for motility issues, which he didn't even give me the opportunity to tell him I've already been on for months with no success). He was so dismissive of my suffering and sent me home with no follow up. Since then, I've seen another gastroenterologist who is now doing a capsule endoscopy (different type).","April 8, 2014",1,1,1,2
Dr. Stephen Sinclair,Dr. Sinclair was extremely friendly. He explained my condition to me in great detail as well what options were available to me.

He deserves a very high rating for being an excellent , skilled doctor and a truly kind and caring individual.","November 22, 2012",5,4,5,5

Dr. Stephen Sinclair,"I have read the other reviews. Although I agree with his knowledge and taking the time with you (resulting in low punctuality scores), I am not as rosy with him.

He answered all of my questions thoughtfully and made sure I understood what he was saying. No one else has ever done this with me before. At times, you may wait for your appointment, but it is certainly worth it. I have a confusing set of results and Dr. S was honest to tell me when he did not know an answer to something that wasn't within his realm of specialty.

Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"Dr. Greenberg is fantastic. He was my first adult GI, and he, along with his office assistant (Anna) and the surgical team have literally saved not only my life, but my quality of life repeatedly since 1999, when I was 18 years old. As a young female I take issue with the negative comments re: Dr. Greenberg's bedside manner; Anna being difficult to reach; etc. Dr. Greenberg has gone above and beyond in accomodating my special needs for treatments, procedures, etc. with compassion and empathy, giving equal importance to my physical, emotional, and mental condition/needs. He doesn't just treat you like a body; he treats you like the multi-dimensional individual you are. He gave me hope when I had none, and I'm happy to report that he was right! I'm so very thankful that he is teaching the next generation of doctors and have had the pleasure of joining him on quizzing his students during my outpatient visits and in-hospital stays. His sense of humour is awesome (and dry), but many people who don't get to know him long-term won't ""get"" him as I do (especially if you're just in for a consult rather than a long-term patient). Furthermore, he is humble and he truly cares about his patients, which, sadly, isn't as common as we'd like to believe. He is very calm, direct, honest, knowledgeable and EXPERIENCED. I always look forward to visiting him!
Now, regarding Anna, the negative comments written by others are very one-sided and don't give ANY consideration to her working conditions! She is ""one-woman show"" and does everything all alone. She is incredibly dedicated to her patients and Dr. Greenberg. for example, she has raised over $10 000 (year after year after year...) in the fight against the very diseases which plague the majority of her patients (including, but not limited to IBD) by participating in the Gutsy Walk (formerly Heel'n'Wheel-a-thon) for Crohn's & Colitis [Foundation of] Canada ON HER OWN TIME and of her own free will. 
[For those of you wondering how she saved my life, with my one phone call to Anna, she arranged my 400km ORNGE hosptial-to-hospital transfer when I had an obstruction and edema, had been treated with a blood transfusion and NG tube vac. I surely would have died had she not arranged the transfer as upon my arrival at MSH I received imaging and was subsequently swiftly taken to the OR for emergency surgery for a gastric perf (among other things)]. My point is that, as with ANY one person operation, Anna MUST prioritize/triage, meaning that the serious issues are dealt with first. Patients must be patient when their need/request isn't of an urgent nature. 
Dr. Greenberg and Anna are a great team and I'm forever in their debt for all they have done for me. All I can do is present you with the facts of my own experience. Best of luck; stay healthy.","March 31, 2015",5,4,5,5

Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"While waiting for my first appointment with Dr. Greenberg, I searched all online reviews. There were several bad reviews from young females, which made me worry as I am a young female and am very sensitive. But I knew Dr. Greenberg was the best. After a sleepless night before my appointment and a lot of nerves because of previous reviews, I had my appointment only to realize that Dr. Greenberg is a great doctor. It's true he's not the most sociable doctor, but do you want someone who chats and makes small talk, or someone who will help you? He gets to the point. When I went for my colonoscopy/scope, my results were normal. But as I lay there on the bed, Dr. Greenberg put his hand on my arm and assured me we'll figure it out. He kept asking if i was okay during the procedure and told me it was almost over and I was doing great. He doesn't seem like the sensitive type, but he is. Please, if you are seeing him for the first time, don't worry like I did about the negative reviews. I have absolute confidence that he will help me figure out what is wrong with me. It is, however, quite difficult to get ahold of his assistant, Anna. The phone is always going to voicemail, and she doesn't always return messages. But if you keep calling you'll eventually get through.","December 27, 2014",4,3,4,5

I cannot believe the one comment below re: invasive procedures...if you have a GI problem, it needs to be 'looked at', there is just no other way. I am thankful for how thorough he is and he was very attentive while I was hospitalized for 2 weeks in February this year.

While I'm sure he is a great with other patients, my experience at 2 separate appointments was a nightmare. I had read the comments about his dislike of young women and found them odd, now I agree and think this was a factor in his treatment of me. He was dismissive from the go, didn't fully listen to my symptoms, berated me, put me through what I believe to be unnecessary invasive tests (sigmoidoscope and digital exams were not routine practice during regular visits with the other 3 GIs I've had). His digital exam left me in tears. When I refused the sigmoidoscope, fearing more pain, he berated me as I cried. He then sent me for an xray to ""prove"" that I was just constipated (I wasn't). The only other time I had an abdomen xray was when my GI thought my colon had perforated. My GP agrees this was unnecessary. Please don't see him, especially if you're a young woman.","June 27, 2014",3,3,1,3
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"I am a very disatisfied patient of Dr. Greenberg. I first seen this doctor a number of years ago when I was very sick with Crohns and he was able to help get me the right treatment. Over the years it appears that he completely lost interest in treating me and left me in the dark without a doctor still coping with Crohns. As his patient, he definitely had a focus on wanting to do invasive tests even when I felt fine and when I told him I was uncomfortable doing that. After this happened a number of times his assistant called me and said that my participation in a study was mandatory and required an invasive test. When I disagreed she said I could not be his patient. I don'tunderstand how any doctor could just turn away a patient in need? And how could he demand testing that in my opinion was not required and punish me by dropping me as a patient? I have called and left messages and tried to make new appointments but never even got a call back. I think patients deserve better than this.","June 12, 2014",4,2,1,1
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"Dr. Greenberg is an amazing doctor. I would recommend him to anyone. Couldn't be happier with my appointment. His secretary, Anna, is an angel.","January 21, 2014",5,5,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"I have been with Dr. Greenberg for over 20 years. I would not go anywhere else. He genuinely cares that you are well and have a good quality of life. He has seen me in emergencies, when I have not been well as well as when I am healthy. Anna is amazing, she is friendly and always takes the time to talk to me when I call or go for an apointment. I do not know what I will do when Dr. Greenberg retires, there is no one to take his place. My Crohn's disease is severe, but Dr. Greenberg has made sure that I live a healthy life, I work full time and manage a household. He always asks about my personal life to see if I am still working and coping. He truly is an amazing person, anyone who gave him a bad review did not meet the true man that he is.","January 17, 2012",5,5,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,I have been seeing Dr. Greenburg since my arrival back in Toronto. I see once a month before my IV and have to say he is a wonderful doctor that makes sure that his patients are followed correctly. He leaves no stone unturned. He is a thinker at times and knows what he is talking about. He cares about his job and is very informative. He is a very integral part of my medical team.,"April 27, 2011",5,5,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,I saw him and wasn't impressed. He asked a few questions but ignored my celiac test results that were mixed and also my food reactions test I had done as well. I never commented on them. He did some blood work and then a lactose test which I had very strong reactions to but his office made it difficult to have a follow up. His dismissive bed side manner was a turn off.,"April 18, 2011",3,3,2,2
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"I've been with Dr. Greenberg since 1987 and will continue to see him until he retires. He has always been completely current regarding treatment for my Crohn's Disease. He located right in Mt. Sinai Hospital so when my symptoms get really bad he's right there to see me every day. When I call, Anna always manages to get me in to see him right away. He sometimes seems to be short on sense of humour, but what he lacks in bedside manner, he makes up for in knowledge and in confidence. He's like most doctors. He's serious when he's at work. and besides, Anna is always there to lighten the mood. She always has a cheerful greeting for me, no matter how long it's been since my last visit. On top of all this, his office and his practice is located right next door to my surgeon, Dr. Zane Cohen, who literally wrote the book on bowel surgery. They work closely together, and I don't believe there is a better gastro-surgical team to be had anywhere in Canada.","November 15, 2010",5,5,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,I went to two other doctors before I found Dr. Greenberg and he was the only one that got me healthy again. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis at a young age and he is very good at listening to the patient. He listened and talked to me rather than my parents and showed concern for my health. I would never go to another doctor!Him and Anna have fit me in with only a few days in advance when I've gotten sick. He also has a very good bedside manner.,"May 11, 2010",5,5,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"Not impressed with this doc. Delayed an important diagnosis by 2 years and believed my symptoms were psychosomatic. Not good for young females - dismissed me and since I didn't have colitis or crohn's he couldn't have cared less. Called to try to get an emergency appointment and couldn't get in for months while my current gastroenterologist got me in right away and provided a diagnosis within weeks. The scope was terrible - when I was having the endoscopy nothing was explained to me and I was held back while chocking. Instead of trying to comfort me, the doctors were talking about office politics. Greenberg has lost his zest and while he may be good for diagnosing colitis and chron's, he certainly isn't interested in anything outside of this realm. I'm so happy that I've moved on.","December 23, 2009",5,1,2,2
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"Excellent specialist in the treatment and care of colitis/crohns disease. Went to him after another specialist and never looked back. Very detailed, meticulous examination of my symptoms and reactions to treatments. Anna is a big part of his practice too and never makes you feel like your call is unnecessary or you are a bother! Highly recommended!","November 23, 2009",5,4,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,Dr Greenberg is a very knowledgable and caring doctor. I was very surprised to see some of the negative comments. I have been seeing him since I was 18 and diagnosed with UC. He is very attentive to the patient (wants to hear the story from the patient rather than second hand from family members) and creates an excellent rapport.,"May 23, 2009",5,5,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis when I was 19, and until I met Dr. Greenberg I was very ill.He is very knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. I'm very surprised to see some patients reviews about Dr. Greenberg,after all I think the main purpose of going to a specialist is to help treat your disease, and he does that very well. I would refer Dr. Greenberg. Keep up the great Work Anna and Dr. Greenberg.","May 12, 2009",5,4,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,This doctor knows his stuff and I'm so glad I was referred to him.. I have been treated by other GI's and there is no comparison. Caring doctor who lets finish before jumping in. I'm actually surprised by some of the bad reviews as I found him to be an excellent clinician. And I do have Crohn's.,"April 18, 2009",5,4,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"Dr. Greenberg and Anna are extremely helpful, kind and fully experts in the field. He has been my doctor for colitis for over 10 years and while he's obviously over-worked, he is always incredibly caring, patient and seems genuinely concerned with my well-being.","March 30, 2009",5,4,5,5
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,This doctor is very unsympathetic to patients. He walks like halfly dead without energy. After 2 or 3 months for the appointment. He only saw you no more than 3 minutes. His staff is not too helpful either. I won't recommend anyone to see him.,"March 26, 2009",2,2,1,2
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"We were sent to this doctor for a 2nd opinion but we shouldn't have bothered. He was rude, made some inappropriate jokes about my husband's condition, and would not even look at me as I was helping to explain my husband's life-long Crohn's. I had detailed notes from my husband's health care over the past 20 years and he didn't even acknowledge me. Rude, a bit strange. Would not recommend.","December 27, 2008",1,3,1,4
Dr. Gordon Greenberg,"Not a pleasant Dr. at all. Unsympathetic, uncaring, mean, rough etc. Just save yourself a whole lot of time and energy and give yourself the respect to see someone else, because you won't get any from this Dr. (if that's what he should be called)","December 13, 2008",3,2,5,3
Dr. Jeremy Theal,"I recently saw Dr. Theal for the first time and he is one of them most wonderful doctors I have ever seen in my life. He took time with me to explain and answer all of my questions. I felt safe and comfortable with him. Usually when I go to Specialist appointments I feel that I am rushed and allotted only a few minutes with them. From the first phone call I received from his assistant Rosa (who was so kind and patient and helpful) to the time 1 walked out of the hospital, I felt that I was in the best hands of care that I could possible be in. I highly recommend this physician.","July 12, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Jeremy Theal,"I was referred to this specialist by my family doctor to do a colonoscopy. Had some concerns and worries cause never had it before.

Dr. Jeremy Theal,"It took my GP over 10 weeks to get a response from Dr Theal's Administrative Assistant to book an appointment. The Dr did all the right things up until the end. The Dr never followed up with me to tell me I had a problem and needed additional care. I left several messages with his assistant, Rosa, but she never would call me back. In my opinion if a patient has a negative result it should be a necessity for the Dr to follow up and a necessity for Rosa to call patients back. The Dr and Rosa are doing their patients a great disservice by being unresponsive on followup with results which may have had a drastic repercussion to me and I'm sure other patients","Submitted November 11, 2015",1,2,2,4
Dr. Jeremy Theal,"He is one of the best Ontario has. Made me feel so relaxed, took his time to explain the procedure, then asked if you have any questions.

I do not appreciate reference to being full of P**P on my X-rays! Dr. Kutcher should learn to read his clients before he tries to be a comedian! I was also not impressed when he hadn't even looked at the test results that were ordered for this meeting. I had to ask him to check them out because he didn't even know he had them. Shouldn't a specialist know why his clients are coming before he meets them? Perhaps review the tests before making a diagnosis? Very mistrusting of this attitude, seen it before with no good results. Women take their health very serious, a little respect goes a long way.","November 6, 2015",3,3,2,2

Dr. Walter Kutcher,I have been to Dr. Kutcher a few times. He was very nice and I felt comfortable with him. Recently I had to cancel an appointment due to illness. His staff member on the phone (Darlene I think)was both rude and condescending to me. She told me because I had cancelled a few appointments (properly rebooked ahead of time... I do NOT abuse the system)that Dr. Kutcher was thinking of not seeing me any more. I would like very much to be able to talk to Dr. Kutcher directly and let him know how his staff treat his patients. I think he would be very disappointed!,"July 7, 2014",1,5,5,5

Dr. Walter Kutcher,I for one appreciate his sense of humor and my last proceedure went without a hitch but his scheduling office staff needs a wake-up call. They never bothered to call me back on a message left to clarify my confusion about the exact time of the appointment. As for the scheduling in regards to hospital proceedures it is trying to be asked to report 2-1/2 hours before treatment and waste several hours in waiting rooms. The hospital as such needs to realise the changing demographics of their clients as it appears that a majority is living in single households or do not have family available for long hours to drive the patient to/from hospital and wait long hours. As for the nurses it is a little bit disturbing that they figured I was scheduled for a colonoscopy as opposed to a endoscopy.,"November 11, 2012",3,5,5,5
Dr. Walter Kutcher,"Dr Kutcher saved my life twice. He has been so comforting and helpful to me. He never made me feel shameful for my lifestyle. I appreciate everything he has done for me, even if I have given him a few more grey hairs.","August 17, 2012",5,5,5,5

The first procedure he did was smooth and I was very comfortable. My only problem was I had a scope and dilatation done on my throat, and he didn't give me enough sedation, and I was very uncomfortable throughout the procedure. He is very kind and gentle, and I wouldn't hesitate to see him again if needed. He did apologize for the procedure being so rough on me, and provided me with pain medication after the procedure was done. I think he realized he didn't give me enough sedation and I am sure the next time he would. It is also hard to judge how much someone needs to be comfortable, so I definitely cut him some slack.","April 11, 2007","Staff

Dr. Patric Tan,"My Husband had his first colonoscopy with Dr. Tan. At the end of the procedure he informed us of all the polyps that were removed. Dr. Tan was honest and told us that there was a mass and that it was definitely cancerous. Dr. Tan told us we could wait for results but after doing this job he knew what he saw was cancer. Despite the intial shock as we were just married and my husband appeared to be in better health than I, it was Dr. Tan and his team that started the ball rolling on a scary process. Dr. Tan immediately got us in with another wonderful surgeon. But it was Dr. Tan's professional experience and calming way of dealing with this diagnosis that left us prepared of what may come. While waiting for appoinments I would call his receptionist at times out of my mind because I was not getting answers and she would help to calm me down and would try to get me the answers I deserved. Although upsetting as it is, it was wonderful to have met a Dr. who was straight forward with what he saw and his team was so helpful when I was at my worst. Thank you for getting his process started and passing us on to another wonderful surgeon.","October 24, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Patric Tan,"Dr. Tan is a very professional, courteous, compassionate doctor. I first saw him for a colonoscopy in 2014 and had a return visit in January because of a change in my health and he reviewed my whole file confirming all my information so he could make the right diagnosis. He is one of the few doctors I have actually seen in the last couple of years that respects my time as well as his own.","January 28, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Patric Tan,Suffered pain 2 years and went to numerous hospitals until I was referred to this doctor who found the problem right away and did not waste time to have the source removed:),"August 27, 2015",3,5,5,5
Dr. Patric Tan,I recently underwent my second colonoscopy at Brampton Civic Hospital. This is the protocol for someone with sleep apnea - it must be done in the hospital. All went well and everything is still normal. I am like and am comfortable with Dr. Tan and I like the anesthesiologist Dr. Gold very much. They and the rest of the staff did a great job.,"March 10, 2015",5,5,5,5
Dr. Patric Tan,Went to Dr. Tan today for a colonoscopy. He was professional and polite. He removed a very large polyp. I felt very comfortable with him and his staff. I am very thankful my family Dr referred me to him.,"November 1, 2013",5,5,5,5
Dr. R. Reynolds,"Anyone hoping to get a referral to Dr. Richard Reynolds is sadly and officially out of luck. As of late December 2014 this AMAZING Gastroenterologist who has mentored and trained dozens of Medical Students retires. I have absolutely no doubt the fortunate Students who had Dr. Reynolds over the years are much better, compassionate, thorough, empathetic, knowledgeable and able to diagnose even the most obscure internal medicine/g.i. related issues. There is, in my humble opinion no other G.I. Doctor with a higher knowledge base of issues relating to Manometry.. and Rick will forever and sadly be missed by this patient of approximately 25 years who saw personally to ensuring an immediate referral was made many years ago to a Thoracic Surgeon after he felt an operation done at his hospital was not done properly. Thank gosh Dr. Reynolds did that because I had only perhaps days left before my fight for survival would have ended.
Enjoy your much deserved retirement Dr. Reynolds and if you're ever reading this know this patient owes you his life.","November 27, 2014",5,5,5,5
Dr. R. Reynolds,"The nurse who made my appointment was wonderful, polite and very efficient. Dr. Reynolds knew how terrified I was and was very patient with me. I have had the procedure done twice now and would never go to another doctor to have it done again if necessary. Best doctor I've ever had. He explains everything that will happen and very clearly explains what he has found during the procedure. He was recommended by a friend and I will never be able to thank her enough.","July 27, 2014",5,5,5,5

Dr. R. Reynolds,"Was referred to this dr by a gastro-surgeon from another city. I left the office crying. The test itself was very humiliating, and on top of it I felt like I was a subject of an experiment done by curious george, so-called assistant. Very inadequate questions in a non-professional manner. I only saw the dr. briefly to tell me that another testing should've been scheduled as well, in order to have a complete picture... I have only been passed around like a bouncing ball for 9 years...what's another month or two.","February 27, 2012",4,5,2,3
Dr. R. Reynolds,"Absolutely, THE BEST. The only doctor in a line of doctors in 5 years that actually listened, did right the tests, sent me to the right people for other opinions and got to the root of the problem. The BEST bestside manner and BEST person to take hold in a situation and find the answer. A true leader. I thought it was ""the end"" for me, you persevered and now it is a ""new beginning"". Thankyou. I am so blessed to have been sent to you. He gets at rating of 110 per cent from me!","October 17, 2011",5,5,5,5
Dr. R. Reynolds,"Dr. Reynolds is truly an exceptionally compassionate and highly skilled Gastroenterologist. I have been treated by him for over 20 years and he has always been at the top of his field both in knowledge and skill. He has a terrific bedside manner and listens to his patients. It is quite amazing that each time I have undergone an Endoscopy or Colonoscopy, the worst part was having the I.V. started.. not the actual procedure. Dr. Reynolds is a true gem to the medical field in London!! Thanks Dr. Rick!!!","June 12, 2011",5,5,5,5

Dr. Sudhir Pandya,"After being diagnosed with GERD 3 months ago, I met different family doctors and went to walk-ins trying to understand why the symptoms were triggered. I was always given the same information that anyone can find on the first page of Google. Then my family doctor luckily referred me to Dr. Pandya, who took time to listen to my history of allergies and all the list of symptoms to arrive at a differential diagnosis. He has been extremely helpful, giving the much needed confidence that this is a disease that can be managed easily. He also changed my medication and I saw dramatic improvement in my symptoms. 
It's a pity he moved to Peterborough from Oakville. Highly recommend the doctor.","November 8, 2016",4,5,5,5

Dr. Sudhir Pandya,"Simply the best. Dr Pandya listens, cares and provides the best advice. I cannot imagine anything more you would want. Throughout my care, he has sat, listened to my concerns compassionately, gave me support and words of wisdom to see through the challenges ahead. I have been very fortunate to have him as my doctor","September 1, 2016",5,5,5,5
Dr. Sudhir Pandya,"I only wish there was a way to award 6 stars on this site. I have seen Dr. Pandya over a 15 year period, including several colonoscopies and another unrelated issue. No other specialist I have ever consulted, in any field, has treated me with the personal respect and dignity that Dr. Pandya has shown. Due to his skill and calming manner, my colonoscopies have required only minimal sedation (clearly this will not be true for everyone!), and he has always carefully explained what he is doing and why. About a year ago, I suffered from an apparently undiagnosable GI problem -- neither my excellent family doctor nor various hospital staff were able to give me answers. I saw Dr. Pandya with a waiting time of only two weeks, and he sat down and actually listened to me carefully, and, without simply and automatically scheduling the endoscopy I had been led to expect from my family MD, he diagnosed my problem and accurately predicted how it would play out. This is so different from the experiences of others I know whose gastroenterologists seem to have become more technicians than diagnosticians. A truly effective and compassionate doctor, whom I cannot rate highly enough!","May 21, 2016",5,5,5,5

Dr. Sabeena Misra,"I am so impressed with Dr. Misra! As she is in such high demand, expect to wait for your initial consultation booking- she is well worth the wait. Knowledgeable, efficient and warm, we discussed my medical history in depth. I felt heard and cared for and she booked me for a colonoscopy and a gastroscopy. I was incredibly nervous about these procedures but Dr. Misra put me at ease and everything went really well. Her staff are incredibly kind and helpful. There is no doctor I'd rather deal with than Dr. Misra- she is excellent.","September 29, 2017",5,5,5,5
Dr. Sabeena Misra,Her staff is courteous and efficient. She is very good as far as skills and knowledge. I found her bedside manner to be lacking however. Both times I had a conversation with her she was rude and abrupt with me. No doctor should be combative before a surgical procedure. I was disappointed and am switching doctors.,"August 29, 2017",5,5,2,4

She is not only very intelligent and knowledgeable but is also very kind to her patients. Yes I had to wait in the waiting room as well (approx. 45 mins) although knowing the wait would be worth it. She is an excellent physician well deserving of a high rating. Trust me I know from the inside!","May 15, 2017",5,4,5,5
Dr. Sabeena Misra,"Every time I go to see her, it is a 2-3 hour wait even to get into an exam room. Very little information or solutions given during a very short visit. Her staff is very good. If she was not the gastro my GP prefers I would not go back.","April 5, 2017",4,1,2,2
Dr. Sabeena Misra,"Honestly, her bedside manner is fantastic but she isn't much of a gastro. She is wonderful for patting old ladies on the hand and giving them medication to help tummy aches, but if you need real work done (ERCPs, etc), you are better off looking elsewhere as it's far outside of her comfort zone and capabilities.

When I asked her if there was another treatment option, she snapped at me. If you desire bedside manner or respectful discussion, do not visit this doctor.

She didn't book my scopes for 9 months in advance as she felt it wasn't necessary but she would do it to keep my Dr. ""happy"" When I went in for my scope she again told me she felt I had no disease but she would do some biopsies.

Not only does she perform all tests and procedures necessary, she always schedules appointments as check-ups, blood work, everything to ensure that the condition is maintained. We are so very lucky to have her as a doctor in Barrie!","January 22, 2008",5,5,5,5

Dr. R Syan,Well I find some of these comments most contradictory. He may be a great surgeon and doctor but he was very RUDE to me when I was there. His staff - top notch but the rude things he said to me were very awful. He helped me a few years ago when I had contracted c-dif so either I was too sick or he has become very unhappy person.

Dr. Lawrence Cohen,"This Dr. told me and I quote ""there is no explanation for your pain"" I had an inflamed gall bladder along with several inflamed gall stones. The pain was unbearable. Because I asked about using Marijuana as treatment for my Crohn's disease some time before that, he treated me like an absolute criminal. He would not even prescribe me any pain relief. Furthermore when I went to consult another Dr about it, this Dr decided to call Dr Cohen and he proceeded to discuss my case and whatever he said to the new Dr, it had the Dr decide that he would not investigate anything that Dr Cohen had done previously. I was an utter mess and quite frankly I was dying. If not for the intervention of my family Dr, who ordered the proper test, then connected me with a surgeon from the same Hospital, who finally removed my Gall bladder. I have recovered thank goodness and absolutely no thanks to Dr Cohen. After everything I have read about waiting for him on this site, DON'T he's not worth the wait.","May 5, 2014",1,1,1,1

I had a morning appt which is probably best if available. Other than that, the experience was better than I thought it would be. The worst part of this process is definately the night before!!!

The staff at the Finch/Keele location are also wonderful.","January 6, 2014",5,4,5,5
Dr. Lawrence Cohen,"Nice guy. Seems Knowledgeable. BUT, the first time I saw him at his Finch/Keele was for a colonoscopy. After a 4 HOUR WAIT for this procedure I was told I needed surgery. Here we are today after 2 major surgeries. I went for my follow up today as recommended by my surgeon. I arrived 20 minutes EARLY for my scheduled appointment. One hour goes by. I ask the receptionist ""what gives?"" She pointed to a sign that basically said to expect waits of up to 3 hours. She also said that I would likely be waiting another 2 hours before he saw me. I told her to tell him he's FIRED! I am not in any condition to be sitting in a doctor's office for 3 or 4 hours waiting nor is it fair to anyone to make them wait so long. It is obvious that this Dr. overbooks and runs a factory. I can understand a possible wait of up to an hour but 3 to 4 hours is ridiculous! Sorry Doc but, I won't be back! I have a few specialists that I see and NONE HAS EVER made me wait more that an hour.","July 5, 2013",1,1,1,3
Dr. Lawrence Cohen,"The absolute best GI ever. Sunnybrook Hospital is one of the best because of you! I have known Dr Lawrence Cohen for over 10 years. He is most efficient, personable, caring. He is one of the few surgeons who would actually TALK to you and ask about your concerns before and after your procedure. It is good to know that Dr Cohen cares about his patients so much that he sends a copy of the report to your home address. I appreciate receiving a copy of my report from his office, as I am the one who should be pro-active about my health issues. He is a great doctor at Sunnybrook in that he meets with the patient and sets them at ease before the procedures.I recommend him and give him an A+++. Dr Cohen, a doctor cannot survive without his patients, and because of your efficiency, calm, personable, approachable nature to patients, we trust your judgement and will return and will recommend others to you. You are the BEST.","June 10, 2013",5,5,5,5

Dr. Lawrence Cohen,"I have had this Doctor for about 7 Years, I've had Crohn's Disease for 25 years. This Doctor is a MONSTER!!! He doesn't listen at all to anything the Patient says, he is a Control freak and after my last meeting with him, where a Family member attended, he unleashed a wrath of fury, screaming at me, pointing fingers, all the while he had no idea WHATSOEVER was going on with my course of Treatment. He likes to spool patinets into the ""REMICADE PROGRAM"", where he'll have little contact with you while prescribing potentially fatal medications. Ihad a minor infusion-site reaction, I called the Remicade Nurses, was ORDERED TO STOP CONTINUING REMICADE INFUSIONS, and frankly, all the Remicade was doing was filling me with toxins, and totally disrupting my life.Dr. Cohen takes 3 weeks to return calls. Never on a Sunday. My Family member, who experienced Open-Heart Surgery, was ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED at Dr. Cohen' Agression.

I found his manner a little warmer at the for-profit office than at the OHIP-paid Sunnybrook procedure. Still, he is very professional, direct and he knows his stuff. My only complaint is that it takes more than a year to get onto his OHIP colonoscopy schedule compared to just 4-weeks for his private-clinic roster. If you want the best, I guess you have to pay for them, one way or another, and he is one of the best.","October 23, 2007",5,5,4,5

When others pushed him for a treatment plan (including my family & hospital team) he opted for more tests, and full results so he could treat me properly.

Within a month he had several tests done on myself as he wanted to make sure he gave me the right diagnosis. My mother is currently seeing Dr. Halder out of Mc Master and what Spaziani did for me in less then a month, she's still waiting for six months for.

He said no she was tested and not it. I finally insisted he retest her and she did have c difficile and had to be admitted to hospital immediately. She was very frail and sick and we were worried we would lose her. Dr Spaziani said to me at one point Well she's lived a good life. I wonder if he would of felt that way if it was his mother.

Dr. Takaki Sameshima,"If you value your health go elsewhere. Equal parts condescending and arrogant, he seems more interested in making snarky comments than helping you with your problem. Appears frustrated and uninterested when you try to elaborate on your symptoms. Does not investigate problems thoroughly and will give up quickly when run-of-the-mill solutions don't pan out. Wastes your time with irrelevant personal questions but rushes you through relevant explanations of symptoms. 
Receptionist will sit and chat with patients or on the telephone while unprocessed patients stand in line for 10-15 minutes. Office rarely answers the phone when you call. 
Perfectly illustrates the old adage - ""Never trust a fat doctor"".","March 21, 2017",2,3,1,1

I wouldn't care for bedside manner if I wasn't ill but let's be honest when your sick you need to be treated like you matter. This doctor is pompous and did not help me actually he GAVE UP! What kind of doctor just gives up and refuses to further investigate. I really do hope karma comes around for this indecent man. I lost so much and still am and he could care less. I really want to know what happend to that hypocratic oath he took back when he became a doctor did it all go out the window? Must have.

He then gave me some advice about what to avoid and within a few weeks, I felt much better. I can't believe his simple advice was so powerful.","December 20, 2016",5,5,5,5

Also, very rude when he talks. Does he think he's god or the only doctor in this country or why does he give his patients who are sick and unwell such a rude show?!

Dr. Dean Chen,"Very poor service, irresponsible,cold and brutal, not caring whatsoever and overall has no any professionalism. While stated fluent in both English and Mandarin on the website yet he told his patients that this is Canada and he speaks only English.

Dr. Dean Chen,"Having just come from my initial appointment with Dr. Chen I can understand the negative comments. He has a general lack of patient empathy. The process to get into a specialist is not a quick one, there are many appointments leading up to it and for me a lot of personal trials and potential solutions tried before the appointment. Thus, when you are told to change your diet and try an OTC fibre pill it can feel very frustrating. While I was not looking for a solution, I didn‚Äôt leave thinking there was an overall plan to address my issue. Actually, given his suggestions were things I had already done, it left me with a feeling of defeat. Moreover, the suggestion of fasting to fix the problem might work but it‚Äôs hard to fit that into the average persons life. I would not recommend him to other. The only exception would be if another doctor had diagnosed you, and you just needed a prescription and you could get an appointment quickly. Lastly at the end of the appointment, he told me he has spent too much time with me and had other patients to deal with (my assumption is he schedules about 10-15 mins per patient) .","February 8, 2016",3,3,1,1
Dr. Dean Chen,"Rude. No bedside manner at all. Also, if you have to call the office, be ready to be put on hold for a very long time. I had to twice and both times was on hold for over 15 minutes.","January 22, 2016",1,3,1,3

Dr. Dean Chen,"I just had an initial consultation with Dr Chen today. His receptionist Sheila was extremely friendly and welcoming. When I met Dr Chen, he as well was very friendly. He took the time needed to listen to my concerns and then he provided me with a lot of information - educating me regarding my concerns. At no time did I feel rushed. He took the time to answer all of my questions and he treated me like a human being and not just a chart. He listened to me and decided on a course of action to deal with my problem that included me in choices made - and reassured me. I left feeling confident in him. That is very important - to trust and have confidence in your health care provider. 
I would recommend this knowledgeable and caring Doctor to anyone.","April 22, 2015",5,5,5,5
Dr. Dean Chen,"Dr. Dean Chen was an enormous prick. That's probably the nicest thing I can say about him. I had already been to two specialists before him, so I had undergone extensive testing for chronic bloating and indigestion. Not only did he barely review my records, he also didn't listen to anything I was saying, and he told me that I had a classic case of ""functional dyspepsia"" and that just meant I required a paleo diet and intermittent fasting. He said that my H pylori didn't need to be treated because ""everyone has H pylori"" and that it's symptomless, but then when he gave me the brochure on functional dyspepsia, it said on the FIRST PAGE that dyspepsia can be caused by H pylori. (And yes, you read that correctly: he said I needed to not eat for the first two-thirds of the day so I would simply experience my bloating during the night. Brilliant, right?)
I then brought up a drug that's been extensively researched to show improvement in patients with IBS-D and abdominal bloating, and he didn't believe me. I showed him the research and he grudgingly prescribed me the med. My insurance company denied it, saying it was too experimental, but that the doctor could appeal on my behalf, which would involve a simple telephone conversation with the insurance company explaining why it might work. He refused to participate. He refused to spend five minutes of his time talking to my insurance company despite the MASSIVE clinical evidence indicating that the drug treats my symptoms. On top of that, the receptionist was one of the rudest, most ill-informed person I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Do NOT see this doctor if you want to be listened to, have your history thoroughly reviewed, and have an advocate on your side.","April 10, 2015",1,3,1,2
Dr. Dean Chen,"I saw Dr. Chen when I had symptoms of gastritis for over 3 months already. I waited more than a month to get the appointment. He was extremely unhelpful. I was suffering for so long, unable work or move on with my life and all he told me is there is no magic pill you have to change your lifestyle. He scheduled an endoscopy that I had to wait for another 2 months and he was unhelpful in explaining to me in any detail what I should do to get better, nor did he prescribe any medication that could help me. After a lot of calling around I scheduled an appointment with the Rudd Clinic for an earlier endoscopy. The doctor there listened to me, explained to me my results, gave me simple two brochures that explained to me in detail what is causing the pain and prescribed 3 months worth of drugs to help me. After this I felt better after two weeks. if I waited for Dr. Chen I still would have extreme stomach pain that would continue to unable me to work of live my life. I would't recommend him.","May 13, 2014",1,4,1,1

When I did not feel comfortable with local physicians for a simple procedure, I was referred to Dr. Chen. My gp had expressed a mild concern which he addressed during the 'routine' procedure. I felt very reassured that there was no reason for concern, and look forward to seeing him at my 5 year checkup!

They booked an in office visit and the only only thing he said me was that he would book me for another colonoscopy in six months. No diagnosis, no guesses, nothing. I had to take time off work to go to his office so he could bill OHIP an office visit just to tell me he booked another appointment. They answer their phones on special days of the week during very select tims. The rest is answering machine that tells you not to leave a message.

In fact, during two of the similar procedures he reported two different results. To me, that is a sign of being incompetent or a lack of caring and concern. He does not return calls, instead relying on his ""nurse"" to call and she doesn't return calls.

When you tell you've been feeling great he suggests putting you on dangerous medications that should be reserved for a last resort! Also when he preforms a coloscopy he never gives me enough medication, I feel the whole proceedure and and even when crying and the nurse asks if she can give you something more he says no. I wonder if he has ever had one done.","December 28, 2008",1,2,2,3

He had recommended that I discontinue a medication that keeps me healthy and active and instead remove my colon that would leave me with a bag on my side for life. I was 33 yrs. old at the time. He has sent letters to my family doctor stating that I was taking certain meds that I wasn't and incorrect doses. He told me that the one drug I am taking, which keeps me healthy, increases my chances of getting cancer by 50% and I should discontinue taking it, which would leave me with colon removal and bag on my side.

I don't believe he even rates one star. Horrible.","December 15, 2016",3,2,1,1

Dr. Khursheed Jeejeebhoy,"His staff is awful, so rude, disorganized. They lost our referral form many times, finally on the day we arrived for our appointment, they said they can't do the procedure as they don't have the referral forms. I had at least 3 confirmed faxes. Also after waiting for an appt for many months, they cancelled it last minute due to some unknown reason. They rescheduled it for 3 more months. Eventually we had to ask for another referral from our family doctore.","August 10, 2015",1,1,1,2

I am forever grateful for this wonderful doctor. May he continue to help the suffering in excellent health and happiness.","April 23, 2015",3,3,5,5

Dr. R Abdalian,"I am a doctor and have a son with Down syndrome who needed an urgent GI endoscopy. Dr. Abdalian accomodated us when others wouldn't. He discussed the case with us patiently before the endoscopy and after, also gave me photos from the procedure. He appeared to be a very competent young gastroenterologist whom I would trust again should the need arise. He treated our son with kindness and dignity. If he fired his office staff, he would be even better.","February 20, 2014",2,5,5,5
